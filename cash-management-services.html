                    <p>In this article we refer to Cash as the paper currency please do not confuse “cash” with liquidity or working capital.</p>
                    <p>Individuals and businesses have a wide range of offerings available across the financial marketplace to help with all types of cash management needs. Banks are typically a primary financial service provider for the custody of cash assets. There are also many different cash management solutions for individuals and businesses seeking to obtain the best return on cash assets or the most efficient use of cash comprehensively.</p>
                    <h2 id="importance-of-cash-management">Importance of Cash Management</h2>
                    <p>There are many parameters on which people evaluate the health of a business. One of the most important parameters is cash. Businesses require cash to manage regular periodic functions that include payment of rent, salaries, utilities and other expenses of daily nature. Businesses follow a cycle of investment, production and sales. Typically, promoters use their own funds or borrow to invest in the business, produce and then earn revenue through sales to recoup their investment. There is a time lag between production and sales during which time businesses need to pay for undertaking daily business functions. Therefore, businesses need cash to pay during this lag period.</p>

                    <p>Technavio says that the value of the market was at USD 27.35 billion in 2019 and is projected to reach USD 44.14 billion by 2024.</p>
                    <p>The rise in the number of ATMs worldwide boosted the growth of the banking sector with the global ATM market estimated to reach $20 billion by 2020.</p>
                    <p>The segment of Cash in Transit has witnessed growth at a noteworthy rate over the past few years and is expected to grow at a higher pace in the forecast period. On the heels of rising cash prevalence particularly in developing countries including China, India, CIC-GDP ratio and installations of ATMs has been on the rise.</p>
                    <p>Key factors driving the robust growth rate of APAC region include amplifying growth in the installation of ATMs, increase in the cash usage, re-monetisation in India, rising need for the replenishment of ATMs coupled with increasing purchasing power.</p>
                    <p>Global Cash Logistics Market Overview and Size The growth in the global cash logistics market has been driven by the first wave of outsourcing of cash management services by banks, financial institutions and retail end users. The growth in ATMs worldwide, especially in developed economies to bring more people under the banking system has been the major growth drivers. The growth in the retail end user segment has been driven by the need for cash automation services. This has forced cash logistics companies to shift away from traditional cash services to smart cash devices to automate retail front and back end cash operations.</p>
