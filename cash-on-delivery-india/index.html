This suggests the end-user will pay for the online purchase to the delivery crew when the delivery happens at the customerâ€™s doorstep, but before accepting the shipment.</p><h2 id=the-history-of-cash-on-delivery>The history of Cash on Delivery</h2><p>COD orders are nothing new. They&rsquo;re popular all over the world ever since mail deliveries began. The first COD parcels are said to have origins in Germany way back in 1857 when people there would buy stuff from neighboring Austria.</p><p>In those days, people could place orders for something by sending a letter to the company. And the company should ship the parcel through the postal system. In those days, people would pay the postman the cost of their purchases.</p><p>There was a major reason for this. A post office served as a trusted medium for cash transactions, since its run by the government of a country. Secondly, Cash on Deliver order would allow companies and businesses to cater to clients at distant locations.</p><h2 id=cash-on-delivery-and-e-commerce>Cash on Delivery and E-Commerce</h2><p>Pioneered by Flipkart, in our times, COD assumes an altogether new meaning. ECommerce companies, popular shopping websites, and other online stores allow this facility for several reasons.</p><p>India&rsquo;s online retailing business is estimated to grow by more than 1,200% to $200 billion by 2026, up from $15 billion in 2016, according to a Morgan Stanley report. Considering this the amount of cash collected on deliveries is only going to increase.</p><h2 id=cash-on-delivery-percentage-in-india>Cash on Delivery Percentage in India</h2><p>As per Nielsen&rsquo;s Global Connected Commerce Survey (Business Insider), about 83% of shoppers in India favored utilizing the cash for all their online purchases. Customers still hesitate to input card information because of different online extortion dangers. A report features that larger part of the payment made by buyers for online stores like Flipkart, Amazon, Shopclues was COD, where 72% were from significant urban communities and 90% from small towns.</p><h2 id=cash-on-delivery-vs-online-payment>Cash on Delivery vs Online Payment</h2><p>Almost all nations where online businesses have flourished, COD has become a standard payment mode for shopping. Among them, some of the countries are India, Bangladesh, Thailand, and so on. So, what makes this mode of payment so accessible, and what are its pros and cons?</p><h3 id=advantages-of-cash-on-delivery>Advantages of cash on delivery</h3><ol><li><p>- You can pay only after you get the product in hand. In that way, there is no risk of loss of money.</p></li><li><p>- Another significant advantage of cash on delivery is that it does not depend on credit or debit cards. This factor is useful in suburban or rural areas where a lot of people do not use cards. The delivery comes, you check the product and pay, and the transaction is complete. It is convenient and straightforward.</p></li><li><p>- COD is more secure you do not have to divulage your financial information, such as credit card or debit card number to seller.</p></li></ol><h3 id=disadvantages-of-cash-on-delivery>Disadvantages of cash on delivery</h3><ol><li><p>- Nearly one-third of the cash-on-delivery (COD) orders placed on leading e-commerce websites in India to stay undelivered, according to a study by San Francisco-based Narvar, accessed by the Times of India.</p></li><li><p>- Only a handful of courier services work with COD and often charge high prices.</p></li><li><p>- As no payment has been made in advance, customers are also more likely to refuse delivery, and you&rsquo;ll be left paying for the return, as well. A study by YourStory found that cash-on-delivery orders had a 40% return rate.</p></li><li><p>- Cash-on-delivery is a slow and inefficient process. Unavailability of cash or change, multiple delivery attempts lead to delays. The amount takes additional time to arrive in the merchant&rsquo;s account owing to multiple settlements reducing the working capital.</p></li><li><p>- Invoices, receipts, and records need to be created and organized manually. The courier does not bring the cash to you on time.</p></li><li><p>- Driving around with cash and merchandise can be unsafe.</p></li></ol><h2 id=cod-vs-dvp>COD vs DVP</h2><p>(COD) and delivery-versus-payment (DVP) describe different procedures and timing of payments given for the exchange of assets, securities, or other goods. Cash on delivery describes a transaction in which the payment of a good or service is made when the good or service is delivered. Delivery-versus-payment is a type of transaction that deals with securities in which the cash payment must be made before or during delivery.</p><p>Cash on delivery (COD) stipulates that goods must be paid for at the time of delivery, or else the goods are returned to the seller. Delivery-versus-payment (DVP) is an arrangement whereby securities are only delivered to the buyer once payment has been made.</p><p>While DVP offers substantial improvement over COD we are yet to see it becoming a norm in the e-commerce sector.</p></article></div></div><br><br><br><h4>You might also want to read :</h4><br><ul><li><a href=/cash-usage-in-india/><h5>Cash Usage in India</h5></a></li></ul><div class=comments-area><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=text/javascript>(function(){if(window.location.hostname=="localhost")return;var dsq=document.createElement('script');dsq.type='text/javascript';dsq.async=true;var disqus_shortname='https-cashport-in';dsq.src='//'+disqus_shortname+'.disqus.com/embed.js';(document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]||document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq);})();</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href=https://disqus.com/ class=dsq-brlink>comments powered by <span class=logo-disqus>Disqus</span></a></div></div><div class=col-lg-4><div class=blog_right_sidebar><aside class="single_sidebar_widget post_category_widget"><h4 class=widget_title>Table of Contents</h4><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#what-is-cash-on-delivery>What is Cash on Delivery?</a></li><li><a href=#the-history-of-cash-on-delivery>The history of Cash on Delivery</a></li><li><a href=#cash-on-delivery-and-e-commerce>Cash on Delivery and E-Commerce</a></li><li><a href=#cash-on-delivery-percentage-in-india>Cash on Delivery Percentage in India</a></li><li><a href=#cash-on-delivery-vs-online-payment>Cash on Delivery vs Online Payment</a><ul><li><a href=#advantages-of-cash-on-delivery>Advantages of cash on delivery</a></li><li><a href=#disadvantages-of-cash-on-delivery>Disadvantages of cash on delivery</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#cod-vs-dvp>COD vs DVP</a></li></ul></nav></aside><aside class="single_sidebar_widget post_category_widget"><h4>Related Articles</h4><br><ul><li>- <a style=margin-top:35px href=/cash-usage-in-india/>Cash Usage in India</a></li></ul></aside><aside class="single_sidebar_widget tag_cloud_widget"><h4 class=widget_title>Tags</h4><ul class=list><div class=blog-tags><li><a href=https://cashport.in//tags/cash/>cash</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href=https://cashport.in//tags/cash-usgae/>cash usgae</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href=https://cashport.in//tags/cash-statistics/>cash statistics</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href=https://cashport.in//tags/cash-on-delivery/>cash on delivery</a>&nbsp;</li></div></ul></aside></div></div></div></section><footer class="footer footer_bg_1"><div class=footer_top><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-xl-4 col-md-6 col-lg-4"><div class=footer_widget><div class=footer_logo><a href=#><img src=https://cashport.in/img/logo.png alt></a></div><p>CashPort helps you move your cash to your account by providing a
