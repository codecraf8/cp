<p>Shivnath Agarwal, aka Bablu aged 43 , rules the market of Tagore
Garden shopping complex in West Delhi through his supreme quality
kirana store. Agarwal Kirana store locally known as Bablu Ki Dukan
by the residents is probably the destination for traditional quality
kirana items ranging from spices to toiletries to packaged food and
what not.</p>
<p>Bablu is a married man. He has his wife Shashi Agarwal, a son Shiv,
aged 7 years and his father Om Prakash Agarwal. Bablu Kirana store
is more like a family heritage for Bablu and is run by him and his wife
at present.</p>

<h4 id="q-why-did-bablu-start-his-business-">Q. WHY DID BABLU START HIS BUSINESS ?</h4>
<p>Bablu was not the one to start his business. It was his father Om Prakash ji instead who had run the business for almost 15 years before he handed it over to Bablu.
