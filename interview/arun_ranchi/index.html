      <h3 id="kirana-chronicles--arun-57-ranchi">Kirana Chronicles | Arun, 57, Ranchi</h3>
<h4 id="q-what-is-the-name-of-the-merchant-and-his-age">Q. What is the name of the merchant and his age?</h4>
<p>My name is Arun Jaiswal and I am 57 years old.</p>
<h4 id="q-name-of-the-shop-and-locality">Q. Name of the shop and locality?</h4>
<p>I have named my shop “Shivgun General Store”. Shivgun means the gunas or attributes of Shiva, the God of destruction in the Hindu trinity; I wanted my shop to take care of my family’s needs the way Shiva takes care of this world. My shop is located in Hehal in the city of Ranchi, and there are different colonies and localities around it. The locality has a mix of people from rural and urban backgrounds.</p>
<h4 id="q-why-did-he-start-his-business">Q. Why did he start his business?</h4>
<p>I started my business after I lost my ad hoc job due to the economic turmoil of demonetization. Since then this shop has been the source of my livelihood for my entire family, and it has served us well.</p>
<h4 id="q-who-are-the-members-in-his-family">Q. Who are the members in his family?</h4>
<p>My family is a close unit. I am the family head and my wife’s name is Usha. I have a son named Ujjwal, and two daughters, Priya and Supriya.</p>
<h4 id="q-when-did-he-start-his-business">Q. When did he start his business?</h4>
<p>I started my business around four years ago. As I said, I had lost my ad hoc job after demonetization and needed a source of living for the family. My business is now the sole means of earning in my family.</p>
<h4 id="q-what-does-his-business-deal-with">Q. What does his business deal with?</h4>
<p>Since I have a small business, I try to stock little quantities of most of the items I can. My shop sells the usual FMCG items you will find in most general stores. Generally, I try to keep small quantities of different items, and bring larger quantities only when demanded by customers. If any customer asks for a particular product, I note it down and get it from the wholesale market the next time I go for my purchases. I also sell fresh vegetables at my store, and frozen nuts and chocolates.</p>
<h4 id="q-how-did-he-manage-the-initial-capital">Q. How did he manage the initial capital?</h4>
<p>The initial capital was not much, we had lost all income sources and started this business with a meagre sum of about 15,000 rupees from my past savings. I have never borrowed money from people for my business, and am very grateful to the almighty.</p>
<h4 id="q-what-were-the-major-difficulties-in-running-his-business">Q. What were the major difficulties in running his business?</h4>
<p>The only difficulty is the stiff competition, there are about nine general stores in the surrounding locality and each one has its own loyal customer base; and ever since the Reliance Market has opened at a short distance, the customers have been preferring that to the limited products we are able to supply. Apart from that, most of the residents are office workers, and they get their shopping done in the bigger shops and marts in the heart of the city.</p>
<h4 id="q-does-he-get-help-from-his-family-members">Q. Does he get help from his family members?</h4>
<p>Mostly I don’t need or rely on support from my family members. Sometimes my wife gives me a respite of an hour or two in the afternoon, or when I go out to buy the stock. My son sits with me in the shop in the evening, and also accompanies me in dealing with the vendors and restocking the supply.</p>
<h4 id="q-how-many-support-has-he-hired">Q. How many support has he hired?</h4>
<p>I have never hired any support. I have a small business, and whenever I am unwell, or busy elsewhere, my family steps in to look out for me.</p>
<h4 id="q-for-the-most-of-time-he-is-in-shop-what-does-he-do">Q. For the most of time he is in shop what does he do?</h4>
<p>I don’t really have much to do, I am mostly busy in the shop or in dealing with different vendors and suppliers. Whenever I have some free time, I like to read the newspaper and talk to people who have shops alongside mine.</p>
<h4 id="q-what-are-his-top-priorities">Q. What are his top priorities?</h4>
<p>My top priority is just to keep the shop running well, like I said, it is the sole means of earning for my family. I also would like to expand the shop, and do something for my son.</p>
<h4 id="q-who-are-his-typical-customers">Q. Who are his typical customers?</h4>
<p>My typical customers are residents of the surrounding localities. Mostly everyone likes to go to the shop but there is one locality that does not have any general store, so they come to mine. Also, I sell vegetables, so people who go out for morning walks generally come to my shop for the fresh vegetables.</p>
<h4 id="q-does-he-use-a-pos-terminal-for-accepting-payments-if-yes-why-if-no-why-not">Q. Does he use a POS Terminal for accepting payments, if yes, why, if no, why not?</h4>
<p>I don’t use any POS terminal, nor do I use any other form of payment other than cash. See, I am not very educated, and I cannot speak or read English, nor is my locality such that people would prefer to use online payment or app payment. My business is conventional and I live with traditional people, so we don’t use these new payment methods.</p>
<h4 id="q-what-is-the-age-of-cash-transaction-at-his-shop">Q. What is the %age of cash transaction at his shop?</h4>
<p>All mine transactions are in the cash mode, like I said, I don’t accept payments in any other form, nor would I be comfortable in using any other form of money other than cash.</p>
<h4 id="q-what-is-the-age-of-qr-code-payments-at-his-shop">Q. What is the %age of QR code payments at his shop?</h4>
<p>There are no QR code payments at my shop, there are only cash transactions.</p>
<h4 id="q-does-he-use-atm-why-does-he-withdraw-money-from-the-atm">Q. Does he use ATM? Why does he withdraw money from the ATM?</h4>
<p>I don’t use an ATM card, in fact, I didn’t have a bank account until very recently. The only bank account I have currently is the Jan Dhan account I recently opened in the nearby bank.</p>
<h4 id="q-how-much-money-does-he-make-in-a-month">Q. How much money does he make in a month?</h4>
<p>It is difficult to say that to be honest. I have even incurred losses sometimes, especially due to the vegetables. There have been times, especially before the lockdown when I would buy the vegetables and no one would buy them from me. Generally I earn enough to take care of my family’s needs, and no matter what we adjust our requirements but have never asked money from anyone ever.</p>
<h4 id="q-does-he-take-loan-from-external-people-for-running-his-shop-if-yes-what-is-the-interest-he-pays">Q. Does he take loan from external people for running his shop? If yes, what is the interest he pays.</h4>
<p>I have never taken any loan to run my business, I have a small business that I set up with my meagre savings, and I do not have any big ambitions from my shop. I don’t think I will ever take a loan in the future, business or otherwise.
I bring all my supplies from the bigger wholesale market in the city, and mostly make payments in cash. A few times, I have asked for credit and I was given a credit period of ten days.</p>
<h4 id="q-how-does-he-re-pay-his-loan---upi--cash--cheque--online">Q. How does he re-pay his loan - UPI / Cash / Cheque / Online?</h4>
<p>Since I have never taken a loan yet, there’s no point.</p>
<h4 id="q-has-he-registered-for-gst">Q. Has he registered for GST?</h4>
<p>No, I have not registered for GST, and in future shall my shop grow and diversify to fall in that range, I will certainly register for GST.</p>
<h4 id="q-how-much-does-he-pay-monthly-for-electricity-phone-gas-shop-rent">Q. How much does he pay monthly for electricity, phone, gas, shop-rent?</h4>
<p>I pay 3,000 rupees for the shop rent, and a few hundred rupees for the electricity bill. There are not many payments that I have to make, and I make all my payments in cash.</p>
<h4 id="q-what-are-the-apps-he-uses-for-running-his-business">Q. What are the apps he uses for running his business?</h4>
<p>I don’t use any app in running my business, the only tool I use is a simple manual calculator; and I don’t even own a smartphone.</p>
<h4 id="q-what-apps-does-he-otherwise-use">Q. What apps does he otherwise use?</h4>
<p>I don’t use any apps, like I said I don’t own a smartphone and am not really comfortable with technology or gadgets. I use the traditional forms of bookkeeping and entertainment.</p>
<h4 id="q-what-does-he-do-in-his-free-time">Q. What does he do in his free time?</h4>
<p>I don’t have much free time. I open my shop at 6:00 a.m. in the morning and remain here till I close it around 8:30 to 9:00 p.m.. The mornings and evenings are rush hours, and I prefer to have dinner and go to bed after I go home. Sometimes, I like to listen to old Hindi songs that my daughters play for me, I especially love Mohd Rafi. Apart from that, there is no leisure that life has afforded me so far.</p>
