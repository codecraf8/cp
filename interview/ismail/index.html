      <h3 id="interview-with-mr-ismail-owner-of-daily-fresh">Interview with Mr Ismail, Owner of Daily Fresh</h3>
<h4 id="q-what-is-the-name-of-the-merchant-and-his-age">Q. What is the name of the merchant and his age?</h4>
<p>The shop is primarily run by Mr Ismail, who is 55 years old. He is partnered with his brother, Mr Akbar, who is 52 years old.</p>
<h4 id="q-name-of-the-shop-and-locality">Q. Name of the shop and locality?</h4>
<p>The shop is called Daily Fresh and is located in the clubhouse of a housing society called Concorde Manhattans in the Electronic City area of Bengaluru.</p>
<h4 id="q-why-did-he-start-his-business">Q. Why did he start his business?</h4>
<p>Ismail says he started the business to earn a livelihood and support his family. “My father used to be a small-time farmer, but after his small leg accident, it became difficult for him to continue work. While he stilled pushed on, I decided to skip college and start this business.”</p>
<h4 id="q-who-are-the-members-of-his-family">Q. Who are the members of his family?</h4>
<p>Ismail stays with his wife and three kids as well as his brother and his family.</p>
<h4 id="q-when-did-he-start-his-business">Q. When did he start his business?</h4>
<p>The business was started in 2016.</p>
<h4 id="q-what-does-his-business-deal-with">Q. What does his business deal with?</h4>
<p>The shop deals with FMCG products as well as other home needs such as vegetables. Right before the COVID pandemic, they had started carrying toys
as well.</p>
<h4 id="q-how-did-he-manage-the-initial-capital">Q. How did he manage the initial capital?</h4>
<p>Ismail and Akbar pooled in their savings and bought the previous shop in the place to begin with.</p>
<h4 id="q-what-were-the-major-difficulties-in-running-his-business">Q. What were the major difficulties in running his business?</h4>
<p>Ismail says, ‘The main problem is the small customer base but the large variance in taste. As we operate inside a society, we can’t have customers from outside. Even then, everyone has so many needs and wants that we have to keep a lot of SKUs. Another issue is the issue of shop-lifting. Kids we can handle easily, but sometimes even the adults indulge in it. It is very tough to confront the residents that way. Lastly, we also have 3 other major three stores that are bigger than us. Competing with them is also a major challenge.’</p>
<h4 id="q-does-he-get-help-from-his-family-members">Q. Does he get help from his family members?</h4>
<p>Yes, he does. ‘My brother is my partner and looks after the shop alongside me. Apart from him, I have my two other cousins helping me out.’</p>
<h4 id="q-how-many-support-staffs-has-he-hired">Q. How many support staffs has he hired?</h4>
<p>Ismail says, ‘I have 6 in total. Three girls and two boys that run the billing counters and do the stocking. The boys also make home deliveries. Apart from them, I have 1 amma that helps in keeping the shop clean.’</p>
<h4 id="q-for-the-most-of-the-time-he-is-in-the-shop-what-does-he-do">Q. For the most of the time, he is in the shop what does he do?</h4>
<p>For most the time, Ismail sits in a corner of his and supervises and aids his support staff. He also keeps his ledgers and stock inventories up to date and places orders as necessary.</p>
<h4 id="q-what-are-his-top-priorities">Q. What are his top priorities?</h4>
<p>‘The number one thing is to make sure that the business stays safe and afloat. I have to make sure that I can feed my family and give my kids a better education than what I received.’</p>
<h4 id="q-who-are-his-typical-customers">Q. Who are his typical customers?</h4>
<p>Residents of the society are his only customers.</p>
<h4 id="q-does-he-use-a-pos">Q. Does he use a POS</h4>
<p>Terminal for accepting payments, if yes, why, if no, why not? He does use a POS Terminal; in fact, he has a couple. He has them because as he put it, ‘Nowadays everything digital. Everyone has a card so I’ll be missing quite a bit of revenue or be forced to give many credit lines, so it makes sense to have them.’</p>
<h4 id="q-what-is-the-age-of-cash-transaction-at-his-shop">Q. What is the %age of cash transaction at his shop?</h4>
<p>The total volume of a cash transaction is roughly 30%.</p>
<h4 id="q-what-is-the-age-of-qr-code-payments-at-his-shop">Q. What is the %age of QR code payments at his shop?</h4>
<p>This is how most of the customers pay and accounts for nearly 50% of all transactions.</p>
<h4 id="q-does-he-use-the-atm-why-does-he-withdraw-money-from-the-atm">Q. Does he use the ATM? Why does he withdraw money from the ATM?</h4>
<p>He does indeed use the ATM. He uses the ATM, which is also inside the society, for primarily paying the salaries and paying for small good deliveries.</p>
<h4 id="q-how-much-money-does-he-make-in-a-month">Q. How much money does he make in a month?</h4>
<p>The shop has a profit of about ₹500,000 a month. While the profit margins are small, the volume makes up for them.</p>
<h4 id="q-does-he-take-a-loan-from-external-people-for-running-his-shop-if-yes-what-is-the-interest-he-pays">Q. Does he take a loan from external people for running his shop? If yes, what is the interest he pays?</h4>
<p>No, he does not have any loans, but he does, however, take credit lines from his suppliers.</p>
<h4 id="q-how-does-he-re-pay-his-loan---upi--cash--cheque--online">Q. How does he re-pay his loan - UPI / Cash / Cheque / Online?</h4>
<p>He doesn’t have any loans, but he usually settles his credit via cash or card.</p>
<h4 id="q-has-he-registered-for-gst">Q. Has he registered for GST?</h4>
<p>Yes, he has.</p>
<h4 id="q-how-much-does-he-pay-monthly-for-electricity-phone-gas-shop-rent">Q. How much does he pay monthly for electricity, phone, gas, shop-rent?</h4>
<p>Everything clubbed together; he spends about ₹100,000 per month.</p>
<h4 id="q-what-are-the-apps-he-uses-for-running-his-business">Q. What are the apps he uses for running his business?</h4>
<p>He uses an e-billing software for billing and inventory management purposes as well as using BharatPe to help him accept and keep track of his QR/UPI Payments.</p>
<h4 id="q-what-apps-does-he-otherwise-use">Q. What apps does he otherwise use?</h4>
<p>Ismail smiled at this question and then very sheepishly said, ‘PUBG’. Apart from the standard business apps, he uses email apps as well as a couple of games, primarily PUBG.</p>
<h4 id="q-what-does-he-do-in-his-free-time">Q. What does he do in his free time?</h4>
<p>Ismail usually returns home at around 10 PM. He helps his kids with their homework and studies and helps his wife with certain household chores. On his off days, he likes taking his kids to the park.</p>
