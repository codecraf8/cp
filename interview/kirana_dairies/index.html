      <h3 id="saif---kirana-dairies">Saif - Kirana Dairies</h3>
<p><strong>September 6</strong></p>
<p>Saif (54) runs a large grocery store in Bhiwandi. He lives with his wife just 10 minutes from the store. He has a daughter who has completed her graduation in Bachelor of Science in Zoology. Saif also has a grandchild who he adores dearly. The grocery store was started by Saif himself close to 20 years ago. It&rsquo;s called Saif&rsquo;s Kirana store. He runs the store with the help of his close friend Tawheed. Due to the current pandemic he had to face lots of difficulties in keeping up with the demand of his customers.</p>
<h3 id="business">BUSINESS</h3>
<p>The store mainly contains essential products which are required by customers on a daily basis i.e grains and pulses. Saif&rsquo;s shop is one of the few Kirana stores in the neighborhood so he has to make sure to store his products in bulk quantities.</p>
<p>The store caters to all the people residing in the neighborhood and is run by Saif, his friend Tawheed and 2 more workers. He doesn&rsquo;t have any kind of assistance with other trading organizations.</p>
<p>The store opens at 8 o&rsquo;clock in the morning and closes at 8 o&rsquo;clock in the evening. It also remains closed between 1pm to 4pm in the afternoon.</p>
<h4 id="q-why-did-you-start-this-kirana-business">Q: Why did you start this Kirana business?</h4>
<p>A: Our family had always owned the land on which the store is situated. For many years  we were planning to make use of it. The absence of any general or grocery store in the vicinity gave us an opportunity to open up our business. Also as grains and pulses are essential goods we knew that it would benefit us to open up a Kirana store in our neighborhood.</p>
<h4 id="q-what-does-your-business-deal-with">Q: What does your business deal with?</h4>
<p>A: We need to supervise the store and make sure everything runs smoothly. We also have to keep the store in stock from time to time. Alongwith the quantity the quality of the products is of utmost importance. We take special care to ensure that our customers are happy with the goods that they purchase from our store.</p>
<h4 id="q-what-are-the-major-difficulties-in-running-this-business">Q: What are the major difficulties in running this business?</h4>
<p>A: The competition between different stores gets quite overwhelming. Due to the opening of certain new stores and supermarkets it becomes bad for our business at times. Many a times, the absence of certain new and upcoming products also hampers our store&rsquo;s business.</p>
<h3 id="finance-and-banking">FINANCE and BANKING</h3>
<p>Saif makes most transaction with his customers by cash. There aren&rsquo;t many card payments at his store.</p>
<h4 id="q-how-did-you-manage-the-initial-capital">Q: How did you manage the initial capital?</h4>
<p>A: I started this store with an investment of around 6-7 lakhs. I borrowed money from my friends and relatives. We even had some savings of ours. All this added up to the amount we invested.</p>
<h4 id="q-do-you-use-a-pos-terminal-for-accepting-payments">Q: Do you use a POS terminal for accepting payments?</h4>
<p>A: We rarely get customers who buy huge amounts of products at a time from our store. Even if customers do buy lots of goods they pay us in cash by installments. So there was never a need to use a POS terminal.</p>
<h4 id="q-what-is-the-percentage-of-cash-transaction-at-your-shop">Q: What is the percentage of cash transaction at your shop?</h4>
<p>A: As I earlier said almost all our customers pay in cash so the percentage is very high.</p>
<h4 id="q-are-there-any-qr-code-payments-at-your-shop">Q: Are there any QR code payments at your shop?</h4>
<p>A: No we don&rsquo;t have customers who pay with QR code method at our store.</p>
<h3 id="loans">LOANS</h3>
<p>Saif has taken several loans from people he is familiar with. Currently he doesn&rsquo;t have any active loan cases. He prefers to borrow money from people he has had an earlier experience with. He generally pays interest rates between 10%-15%</p>
<h4 id="q-by-what-means-do-you-repay-your-loan">Q: By what means do you repay your loan?</h4>
<p>A: I mostly use cheque and cash method. But it depends on the person who I need to return the money to.</p>
<h4 id="q-do-you-use-the-atm-frequently">Q: Do you use the Atm frequently?</h4>
<p>A: Yes, I do. For the store and even for personal matters I need to withdraw money frequently.</p>
<h3 id="payments">PAYMENTS</h3>
<p>Saif has a fixed payment for different people. Apart from that there is also a particular amount kept aside for buying products for the store</p>
<h4 id="q-how-much-money-do-you-make-in-a-month">Q: How much money do you make in a month?</h4>
<p>A: It depends on the amount of sale we have daily. Due to pandemic right now we have lots of demands and our shop has good business. But to answer your question I generally get somewhere between 18000-20000 in a month.</p>
<h4 id="q-how-much-do-you-pay-monthly-for-electricity-phone-shop-rent">Q: How much do you pay monthly for electricity, phone, shop rent?</h4>
<p>A: I don&rsquo;t need to pay for the shop as I own it. But for the electricity and other bills monthly around Rs 5000 is spent.</p>
<h4 id="q-have-you-registered-for-gst">Q: Have you registered for GST?</h4>
<p>A: Yes we have registered for GST some months ago.</p>
<h3 id="employees">EMPLOYEES</h3>
<p>Saif has hired two young boys to help in running the shop. Apart from them his friend Tawheed also helps in the affairs of the shop.</p>
<h4 id="q-how-much-payment-do-the-employees-get">Q: How much payment do the employees get?</h4>
<p>A: I pay them both 6000 per month depending upon the work they do. Tawheed runs the shop in my absence as I am a bit old and have certain health issues.  I pay him 10000-11000 a month.</p>
<h4 id="q-are-the-two-workers-good-at-their-work">Q: Are the two workers good at their work?</h4>
<p>A: Yes they are capable young boys who have helped us a great deal in managing the store. They do their jobs very well.</p>
<h4 id="q-besides-the-work-that-they-do-at-the-store-what-other-help-do-they-provide">Q: Besides the work that they do at the store what other help do they provide?</h4>
<p>A: Sometimes certain customers are not able to come to the store to get the products they need so the boys deliver the things to the customers house themselves.</p>
<h3 id="customers">CUSTOMERS</h3>
<p>The main customers of the store are people residing in the surrounding neighborhood. Saif generally knows most of the customers personally as he has been living here his entire life.</p>
<h4 id="q-who-are-your-typical-customers">Q: Who are your typical customers?</h4>
<p>A: We have people from the neighborhood and mostly housewives. Even lots of children come to our store on a regular basis.</p>
<h4 id="q-what-are-your-top-priorities-regarding-customers">Q: What are your top priorities regarding customers?</h4>
<p>A: I always aim that my customers are satisfied with the quality of our products and that they believe that the amount for a particular item is worth the money they pay.</p>
<h4 id="qhave-you-ever-had-any-bitter-experience-with-a-customer">Q:Have you ever had any bitter experience with a customer?</h4>
<p>A: Well you know that every coin has two sides. Yes we have had customers who sometimes weren&rsquo;t happy with the price or maybe the quantity. But they were just grievances which are quite common in any trade. We never had anything serious to worry about.</p>
<h3 id="other">OTHER</h3>
<p>Saif also helps other people with some business matters in his free time. He gets along well with the people in his neighbourhood. He likes spending time with his family and friends.</p>
<h4 id="q-apart-from-work-what-other-things-keep-you-busy">Q: Apart from work what other things keep you busy?</h4>
<p>A: I am a religious person so whenever I&rsquo;m free I pray to the almighty for everything that he has bestowed upon me in terms of health and well being. I also meet with my friends and play certain games.</p>
<h4 id="q-what-do-you-like-doing-most-in-your-free-time">Q: What do you like doing most in your free time?</h4>
<p>A: I love spending time with my grandchild. He always takes away all my tiredness and makes me happy. I also look forward to meeting my daughter.</p>
<h3 id="about-the-interview">About the interview:</h3>
<p>The above documentation was done with the full consent of the concerned participant. The interview was taken in the native language of the participant and then translated to English. The identities of certain places and people have been changed so as to honour the person&rsquo;s wishes.</p>
