<p>Nitish Goyal, a 26 years old young man, runs the Radhey Shyam Departmental Store in the rustling bustling streets of Geeta Colony, East Delhi. Following the legacy of his father, Nitish continues to run the business his father started to make a living the only way he knew.
He dwells in a small house almost next to his shop with his parents and a younger sister. For nine years, Nitish and his father have been earning the bread by actually selling bread to the customers that visit the store. In 2011, this departmental store found its existence in the busy streets of Geeta Colony catering to diverse grocery demands of a household and to the sweet tooth of the kids that visit the store as well. Nitish’s father, Radhey Shyam spent his hard-earned savings from his old business as the capital to set this store up where it stands now.</p>
<p>Running the business has not always been easy for Nitish in the face of economic adversity. Earning regular customers was challenging in the initial business years. Even with the regular customers, times such as the demonetization and the pandemic affected their business. However, Nitish has always found peace with his business in the face of all these challenges. Although managing the store entirely by himself, Nitish at times finds strength from his father and turns to him for any help, if needed, in the business.</p>
<p>Nitish keeps a record of the supplies and sales and his friendly countenance furthermore facilitates to keep the customers satiated with their demands.</p>
<p>The dwellers of his locality are his regular customers who find him friendly and have kept coming back at the store over the years.
Nitish doesn’t use POS Terminal for accepting payments as the traditional method of cash transactions is the only way they have known how to do business. However, since the demonetization, they have started accepting payments through Paytm but only through his personal account. Nitish finds comfort in running the business with cash exchange and does not necessarily ask for digital payments.</p>
<p>Nitish has been to a bank but hasn’t ever withdrawn money from an ATM himself. On an average, the revenue that the business generates is 40,000 rupees a month. The revenue has mostly catered them enough to suffice their needs and saved them the trouble of having any kinds of loans. He hasn’t registered for GST. The electricity bills and the maintenance cost them 20,000 rupees a month on an average and a fixed amount of 399 rupees is spent in paying the monthly phone bills.</p>
<p>He finds himself engrossed in the stock and supplies calculations in his free time and when his mind is at ease, he enjoys playing any mobile game on his phone.</p>
