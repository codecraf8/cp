      <h3 id="sridevi-kirana-and-general-stores">Sridevi kirana and General stores</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Shalini (45) runs the shop “Sridevi kirana and General stores” in Visakhapatnam. She lives with her husband, daughter,son and a small pet in a rented house. Her daughter is studying in 7th standard and his son is in the final year of Degree, started her business long ago when she completed her intermediate as she is the only daughter of the family and the shop was handed over to her by her father. She has been running the shop ever since.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her business deals with all the groceries and other sundries like Rice, Dal, Flours (Wheat Flour, Rice Flour, etc.),Sugar/Jaggery, Pices (Khada Masalas &amp; Powdered Masalas), Vegetables (Onions &amp; Potatoes), Tea/Coffee, Snacks and many more.Timings of her store starts from morning 9:00 a.m. — 9:30 p.m, and she takes lunch break from 1:00 a.m. — 2:00 p.m in the afternoon.</p>
<h4 id="about-her-daily-life-in-shop-">About her daily life in shop :</h4>
<p>-  Shalini says “ she is busy everyday handling things at the shop by contacting the traders and many more.</p>
<p>-  “The first thing she does in the shop if she gets free time is she looks after the goods that need to be reordered again and what are the goods that need to be returned due to damage or the expiry of the products.”
-  And also she hired one girl named Kalpana, with the help of her servant who works in her home and that girl is an orphan who works part time for her living, she has been working in that store for the past 4 years.”
-  She says it is not just the different types of local products they sell.She says that she usually provides free delivery in less than an hour for regular customers.</p>
<h4 id="finance--investments">Finance &amp; Investments:</h4>
<p>-  She said“ She managed with the help of his ancestors' properties and for developing it she took help from a bank which provided loans.”
-  She said her family whoever gives her a helping hand for financial support is a Bank. With a small smile on her face, she said there is no one to help me from my family members side. Because theirs was a love marriage and no one supported her once she got married and she totally relies on banks for loans and pays an interest of 2.12%.
-  And she does not use POS Terminal for accepting payments, but uses it like everybody using GPay and other payment apps.
-  In this pandemic season Covid-19 it is not more than 3% of the cash and QR code transactions.</p>
<h4 id="challenges-she-faces-in-her-daily-life-">Challenges she faces in her daily life :</h4>
<p>-  At times they face challenges like hiring employees whereas when the employee takes leave and in her(employee) absence she faces challenges because she cannot continue to manage both her business hours and personal hours.
-  Yes, she says that she cannot spend some summer time with their family going out for a vacation.
-  And also, there are ups and downs in the business when they get low profit when compared to the peak seasons. For example they used to have a good profit before corona times whereas now the business is too low and it is difficult for them to sustain. So, at these times like in pandemic season “She says that, they avoid taking any breaktime away from work.”</p>
<h4 id="typical-customers-she-faces-everyday-">Typical Customers she faces everyday :</h4>
<p>-  She laughed aloud and replied “I don&rsquo;t know hindi and bengali language and most of the customers are bengalis and they either speak in hindi nor bengali where I cannot match with them” this will be the hectic phase I face everyday and at this time customers think that they are not getting proper service from our end.</p>
<h4 id="profits-">Profits :</h4>
<p>-  She said”She withdraws money from the ATM is an easy task and she said instead of having lumps of money around me wherever I go, It is better to withdraw the money whenever I need as it provides the service round the clock at any time at anyplace and registered with GST and pays it through UPI and cheque’s sometimes. It depends.
-  She says the profit can be 30,000/- per month or 3000/- due to this covid-19 the business can be like up n down.
These are few answers that were asked to the merchant  :</p>
<h4 id="question-how-much-does-he-pay-monthly-for-electricity-phone-gas-shop-rent">Question: How much does he pay monthly for electricity, phone, gas, shop-rent?</h4>
<p>She said “Everytime it is not the same to pay the bills dear. It depends on our usage. The
bills of electricity,phone and gas differ from month to month and as I have told you the shop is mine and there is no rent to be paid for it.</p>
<h4 id="question-what-are-the-apps-he-uses-for-running-his-business">Question: What are the apps he uses for running his business?</h4>
<p>Paytm, PhonePe,Gpay,AmazonPay as far as now these are the apps that she uses for
