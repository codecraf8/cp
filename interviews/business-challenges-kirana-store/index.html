The grocery store was started by Saif himself close to 20 years ago when he saw an opportunity to utilize their barren land in a way. Saif’s shop is one of the few Kirana stores in the neighborhood so he has to make sure to store his products in bulk quantities. Although he <strong>faces heavy competition from the neighbouring supermarkets</strong> and departmental stores, he makes sure his products remain up to date.</p><p>He lives with his wife just 10 minutes from the store. He runs the store with the help of his close friend Tawheed. The store mainly contains essential products which are required by customers on a daily basis i.e grains and pulses. The store caters to all the people residing in the neighborhood and is run by Saif, his friend Tawheed and 2 more workers. He <strong>doesn’t have any kind of assistance with other trading organizations</strong>. The shop remains open from 8 in the morning to 8 in the evening. However, it remains closed between 1pm to 4pm in the afternoon.</p><h3 id=business>Business</h3><img src=/img/kirana-kahani/business-challenges-kirana-store/cashport.jpg width=80%><ol><li><p>- The main customers of the store are people residing in the surrounding neighborhood.</p></li><li><p>- Saif generally knows most of the customers personally as he has been living here his entire life.</p></li><li><p>- Saif has hired two young boys to help in running the shop. Besides, his friend Tawheed also helps in the affairs of the shop.</p></li><li><p>- His typical customers are women and children from the neighbourhood, and they pay mostly in cash.</p></li></ol><h4 id=q-why-did-you-start-this-kirana-business>Q: Why did you start this Kirana business?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> Our family has always <strong>owned the land</strong> on which the store is situated. For many years we were planning to make use of it. The absence of any general or grocery store in the vicinity gave us an opportunity to open up our business. Also as grains and pulses are essential goods we knew that it would benefit us to open up a Kirana store in our neighborhood.</p><h4 id=q-what-does-your-business-deal-with>Q: What does your business deal with?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> The store mainly contains essential products which are required by customers on a daily basis i.e grains and pulses. We need to supervise the store and make sure everything runs smoothly. We also have to keep the store in stock from time to time. Alongwith the quantity the quality of the products is of utmost importance. We take special care to ensure that our customers are happy with the goods that they purchase from our store.</p><h4 id=q-what-are-the-major-difficulties-in-running-this-business>Q: What are the major difficulties in running this business?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> The competition between different stores gets quite overwhelming. Due to the opening of certain new stores and supermarkets it becomes bad for our business at times. Many a times, the absence of certain new and upcoming products also hampers our store’s business.</p><h4 id=q-who-are-your-typical-customers>Q: Who are your typical customers?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> We have people from the neighborhood and mostly housewives. Even lots of children come to our store on a regular basis.</p><h4 id=q-what-are-your-top-priorities-regarding-customers>Q: What are your top priorities regarding customers?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I always aim that <strong>my customers are satisfied with the quality of our products</strong> and that they believe that the amount for a particular item is worth the money they pay.</p><h4 id=qhave-you-ever-had-any-bitter-experience-with-a-customer>Q:Have you ever had any bitter experience with a customer?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> Well you know that every coin has two sides. Yes we have had <strong>customers who sometimes weren’t happy with the price</strong> or maybe the quantity. But they were just grievances which are quite common in any trade. We never had anything serious to worry about.</p><h4 id=q-are-the-two-workers-good-at-their-work>Q: Are the two workers good at their work?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes they are capable young boys who have helped us a great deal in managing the store. They do their jobs very well.</p><h4 id=q-besides-the-work-that-they-do-at-the-store-what-other-help-do-they-provide>Q: Besides the work that they do at the store what other help do they provide?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> Sometimes certain customers are not able to come to the store to get the products they need so <strong>the boys deliver the things to the customer’s house</strong> themselves.</p><h3 id=finance>Finance</h3><img src=/img/kirana-kahani/business-challenges-kirana-store/finance.jpg width=80%><ol><li><p>- Saif makes most of the transactions with his customers by cash.</p></li><li><p>- There aren’t many card payments at his store.</p></li><li><p>- He started his business with an initial investment of 6-7 lakhs.</p></li><li><p>- He now makes around 1 to 2 lakh per month.</p></li><li><p>- Saif has taken several loans from people he is familiar with.

He generally pays interest rates between 10%-15%</p></li><li><p>- Saif has a fixed payment for different people. Apart from that there is also a particular amount kept aside for buying products for the store</p></li></ol><h4 id=q-how-did-you-manage-the-initial-capital>Q: How did you manage the initial capital?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I started this store with an <strong>initial investment of around 6-7 lakhs</strong>. I borrowed money from my friends and relatives. We even had some savings of ours. All this added up to the amount we invested.</p><h4 id=q-do-you-use-a-pos-terminal-for-accepting-payments>Q: Do you use a POS terminal for accepting payments?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> We rarely get customers who buy huge amounts of products at a time from our store. Even if customers do buy lots of goods they pay us in cash by installments. So there was <strong>never a need to use a POS terminal</strong>.</p><h4 id=q-what-is-the-percentage-of-cash-transactions-at-your-shop>Q: What is the percentage of cash transactions at your shop?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> As I earlier said almost all <strong>our customers pay in cash</strong> so the percentage is very high.</p><h4 id=q-by-what-means-do-you-repay-your-loan>Q: By what means do you repay your loan?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I mostly use cheque and cash method. But it depends on the person who I need to return the money to.</p><h4 id=q-do-you-use-the-atm-frequently>Q: Do you use the Atm frequently?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, I do.

Due to pandemic right now we have lots of demands and our shop has good business. But to answer your question I generally <strong>get somewhere between 18000-20000 in a month.</strong></p><h4 id=q-how-much-do-you-pay-monthly-for-electricity-phone-shop-rent>Q: How much do you pay monthly for electricity, phone, shop rent?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I don’t need to pay for the shop as I own it. But for the electricity and other bills monthly around Rs 5000 is spent.</p><h4 id=q-have-you-registered-for-gst>Q: Have you registered for GST?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes we <strong>registered for GST</strong> some months ago.</p><h4 id=q-how-much-payment-do-the-employees-get>Q: How much payment do the employees get?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I pay them both 6000 per month depending upon the work they do. Tawheed runs the shop in my absence as I am a bit old and have certain health issues. I pay him 10000-11000 a month.</p><h3 id=online-payment>Online Payment</h3><img src=/img/kirana-kahani/business-challenges-kirana-store/online.jpg width=80%><h4 id=q-are-there-any-qr-code-payments-at-your-shop>Q: Are there any QR code payments at your shop?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> No we don’t have customers who pay with the QR code method at our store.</p><h5 id=other>OTHER</h5><ol><li><p>- Saif also helps other people with some business matters in his free time.</p></li><li><p>- He gets along well with the people in his neighbourhood.</p></li><li><p>- He likes spending time with his family and friends.</p></li></ol><h4 id=q-apart-from-work-what-other-things-keep-you-busy>Q: Apart from work what other things keep you busy?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I am a religious person so whenever I’m free I pray to the almighty for everything that he has bestowed upon me in terms of health and well being.
