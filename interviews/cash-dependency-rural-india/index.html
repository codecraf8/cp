He started out as an employee in a small shop where he gathered his ideas of owning and running a business. He is a first generation shop owner who has been successfully running the business for more than thirty years now. But that did not happen overnight. Initially, he was faced with quite some financial difficulties when customers struggled to trust the new shop owner. Eventually over the years, with consistent supply of quality goods, he earned their faith. TK Manikuttan, now 62 years old, runs a provisional store in Kaduthuruthy village of Kerala.</p><p>He lives with his family in Kaduthuruthy near his shop. His customers love him and he often goes out of the way to keep them happy. He even personally delivers groceries to old or sick people who are unable to make it to the shop, although there is no home delivery system in place.</p><h3 id=business>Business</h3><img src=/img/kirana-kahani/cash-dependency-rural-india/cashport.jpg width=80%><ol><li><p>- Mr. Manikuttan used to work in a small shop before he opened his own business.</p></li><li><p>- The shop has been in place and running for about 36 years.

From there I started my own business to lead a better life and provide for my family. The job itself gave me some experience and the basic knowledge to start a business of my own.</p><h4 id=q-who-are-the-members-in-your-family>Q: Who are the members in your family?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> My family includes my wife and two daughters.</p><h4 id=q-when-did-you-start-your-business>Q: When did you start your business?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I started my business almost 36 years ago in 1984. I am proud to say that we have grown and come a long way from where we began.</p><h4 id=q-what-does-your-business-deal-with>Q: What does your business deal with?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I would say that we are a provisional store. We sell almost everything that is needed daily in a household like food supplies, stationary items, packaged goods and other groceries.</p><h4 id=q-what-were-the-major-difficulties-in-running-your-business>Q: What were the major difficulties in running your business?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I had to overcome two major difficulties when I started my business. The first one was financial. With the initial expenses and my lack of experience in actually running a business cost me a lot. However, as I gained more experience I was able to properly manage my finances. The second hurdle I faced was the lack of customer loyalty. But I knew that no business will have its own regular customers as soon as it started. I concentrated on providing my customers with the best and worked sincerely till they started choosing my shop on a regular basis. Out of both of these problems I would say that the financial troubles definitely outweighed the other. Lately new problems have been arising for me because of Corona and the lockdown as well. Business has been much slower than usual but the fact that my shop has been around for so long has helped build trust among people. Whatever happens, being safe is the most important part.</p><h4 id=q-do-you-get-help-from-family-members>Q: Do you get help from family members?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> My family is the best support system I could have asked for. As I said before, they believe in me and they try to help in every way possible.</p><h4 id=q-how-many-supporters-have-you-hired>Q: How many supporters have you hired?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I have hired 2 employees to help me around the store.</p><h4 id=q-what-do-you-usually-do-while-you-are-in-the-shop>Q: What do you usually do while you are in the shop?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I am usually managing and supervising while I am in my shop. I also handle the cash transactions and make sure the customers have everything they need.</p><h4 id=q-what-are-your-top-priorities>Q: What are your top priorities?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> My top priority is definitely the satisfaction of my customers. This includes selling only good quality products at the right price and making sure that the customers receive the best treatment while they are shopping. Being in the business for such a long time, I have also built many great personal relationships with my customers. I go out of my way to make sure that they all remain happy with my service. Even though we do not have a designated system for home delivery of items, I personally deliver groceries to old or sick people who are unable to make it to the shop. After all, customer satisfaction is my top priority.</p><h4 id=q-who-are-your-typical-customers>Q: Who are your typical customers?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I have all kinds of regular customers in the shop. There are customers who shop for their daily household groceries. I also supply hotels, bakeries, any special functions and so on.</p><img src=/img/kirana-kahani/cash-dependency-rural-india/finance.jpg width=80%><ol><li><p>- His initial capital was arranged by his family and he never had to depend on any loan for the initial investment.</p></li><li><p>- Since his shop is perched in a village in Kerala where people are not accustomed to card and QR transactions, he doesn’t have any POS system in place.</p></li><li><p>- His profits are around 25000 INR per month and he spends about 3500 to pay his rent, electricity, phone and gas.</p></li></ol><h4 id=q-how-did-you-manage-your-initial-capital>Q: How did you manage your initial capital?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> Most of my initial investment came from my family members itself. I am really grateful that I have such a wonderful family who believed in me enough to invest in my dreams.</p><h4 id=q-do-you-use-a-pos-terminal-for-accepting-payments-if-yes-why-if-no-why-not>Q: Do you use a POS terminal for accepting payments? If yes, why? If no, why not?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> No I do not use a POS terminal for accepting payment. The method of payment in the shop is currently limited to cash only. As of now we have no other option of payment. This is mainly because of the location of my shop and the somewhat rural community around the area. Most of my customers, if not all of them, prefer cash transactions to any other method.</p><h4 id=q-what-is-the-percentage-of-cash-transactions-in-your-shop>Q: What is the percentage of cash transactions in your shop?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I would say it is a hundred percent.</p><h4 id=q-do-you-use-the-atm-why-do-you-withdraw-money-from-the-atm>Q: Do you use the ATM? Why do you withdraw money from the ATM?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I usually do not use the ATM for business purposes. I do however, use it for personal transactions.</p><h4 id=q-how-much-money-do-you-make-in-a-month>Q: How much money do you make in a month?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I make around 25000 INR per month in profits.</p><h4 id=q-do-you-take-loans-from-external-people-for-running-his-shop-if-yes-what-is-the-interest-you-pay>Q: Do you take loans from external people for running his shop? If yes, what is the interest you pay?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I have not taken a loan from external people for running the shop. I had taken a loan from the bank before but that has been paid off for a long time.</p><h4 id=q-have-you-registered-for-gst>Q: Have you registered for GST?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes I am GST registered.</p><h4 id=q-how-much-do-you-pay-monthly-for-electricity-gas-phone-shop-rent>Q: How much do you pay monthly for electricity, gas, phone, shop-rent?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I pay around 3500 INR for all of these expenses together.</p><h3 id=online-portals>Online Portals</h3><img src=/img/kirana-kahani/cash-dependency-rural-india/online.jpg width=80%><ol><li><p>- Mr. Manikuttan does not use any apps to run his business whatsoever.</p></li><li><p>- He also doesn’t accept QR or UPI transactions which leaves out any online portals as well.</p></li><li><p>- Since he lives in a rural area, people are not accustomed to using online portals or cards. Therefore, he has never faced the demand of having the system in place.</p></li></ol><h4 id=q-do-you-use-any-apps-for-running-the-business>Q: Do you use any apps for running the business?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I do not make use of any apps for running this business. Like I mentioned before, the shop is in a somewhat rural area and the people here do prefer direct transactions than online ones.</p><h4 id=q-what-apps-do-you-use-otherwise>Q: What apps do you use otherwise?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I do not depend on my phone much but I do use apps like Facebook and WhatsApp when I have time.
S : What is the percentage of QR code payments at your shop?
<strong>A:</strong> Since I depend solely on cash transactions, it would be zero.</p><h4 id=q-what-do-you-do-in-your-free-time>Q: What do you do in your free time?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> The only free time I get is usually limited to just Sundays and I like to spend as much of this time as I can with my family at home.</p></article></div></div><br><br><br><h4>You might also want to read :</h4><br><ul><li><a href=/interviews/jobless-worker-kirana-merchant/><h5>From jobless to a Kirana store owner</h5></a></li><li><a href=/interviews/office-worker-kiranan-merchant/><h5>From an Office Worker to a Kiranan Merchant</h5></a></li><li><a href=/interviews/female-perspective-kirana-merchant/><h5>A Woman’s Take on Business Tactics</h5></a></li><li><a href=/interviews/traditional-kirana-merchant/><h5>A Quaint Shop in a Quaint Town</h5></a></li></ul><div class=comments-area><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=text/javascript>(function(){if(window.location.hostname=="localhost")return;var dsq=document.createElement('script');dsq.type='text/javascript';dsq.async=true;var disqus_shortname='https-cashport-in';dsq.src='//'+disqus_shortname+'.disqus.com/embed.js';(document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]||document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq);})();</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href=https://disqus.com/ class=dsq-brlink>comments powered by <span class=logo-disqus>Disqus</span></a></div></div><div class=col-lg-4><div class=blog_right_sidebar><aside class="single_sidebar_widget post_category_widget"><h4 class=widget_title>Table of Contents</h4><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#business>Business</a></li><li><a href=#online-portals>Online Portals</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></aside><aside class="single_sidebar_widget post_category_widget"><h4>Related Articles</h4><br><ul><li>- <a style=margin-top:35px href=/interviews/jobless-worker-kirana-merchant/>From jobless to a Kirana store owner</a></li><li>- <a style=margin-top:35px href=/interviews/office-worker-kiranan-merchant/>From an Office Worker to a Kiranan Merchant</a></li><li>- <a style=margin-top:35px href=/interviews/female-perspective-kirana-merchant/>A Woman’s Take on Business Tactics</a></li><li>- <a style=margin-top:35px href=/interviews/traditional-kirana-merchant/>A Quaint Shop in a Quaint Town</a></li></ul></aside><aside class="single_sidebar_widget tag_cloud_widget"><h4 class=widget_title>Tags</h4><ul class=list><div class=blog-tags><li><a href=https://cashport.in//tags/cash-dependency/>cash dependency</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href=https://cashport.in//tags/rural/>rural</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href=https://cashport.in//tags/kirana-store/>kirana store</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href=https://cashport.in//tags/traditional/>traditional</a>&nbsp;</li></div></ul></aside></div></div></div></section><footer class="footer footer_bg_1"><div class=footer_top><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-xl-4 col-md-6 col-lg-4"><div class=footer_widget><div class=footer_logo><a href=#><img src=https://cashport.in/img/logo.png alt></a></div><p>CashPort helps you move your cash to your account by providing a
