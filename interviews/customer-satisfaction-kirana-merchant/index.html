He rented a place and started selling groceries and made just enough to support his family initially. Over the years, the shop flourished and earned a stable customer base that generated quite some revenue. Tarun’s elder brother, Akhil, did not want any part of the shop.

Tarun wants to take full advantage of the power of technology and plans to transform his business into an online cartel.</p><p>He lives in Kalkaji, Delhi with his wife and two daughters.
