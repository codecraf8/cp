Laxman always had an aversion for the 9 to 5 jobs, he wanted to build something of his own. Therefore, he jumped at the opportunity of starting a kirana store after his graduation. Fighting his way through the tough competition, Laxman built a supermarket from his small store to quench his ambition. He is now the owner of Ashoka supermarket and has been running it for over 20 years.</p><p>He lives in Indrapuri with his wife and 2 children. His son joined him a few years ago and has been of great help ever since. Laxman hopes that his son will expand their business. He is certain that his son would better handle the technical and business aspects alike.</p><h3 id=business>Business</h3><img src=/img/kirana-kahani/day-life-kirana-merchant/cashport.png width=80%><ol><li><p>- Ashoka supermarket is <strong>the go-to store for FMCG products</strong> for the residents of Indrapuri. It is especially convenient for those who want to shop early in the morning as it opens at 7 a.m.</p></li><li><p>- Laxman has <strong>hired 3 employees</strong> and runs it with their help. They all work in rotational shifts.</p></li><li><p>- Even though the footfall has decreased since the lockdown, Mr. Laxman says the peak hours, on most of the days are from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. and 6 p.m. to 10 p.m.</p></li></ol><h4 id=q-why-did-you-start-this-business>Q: Why did you start this business?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> As a young man, I wanted to start something of my own and the kirana business seemed like <strong>the most profitable employment option.</strong> Therefore I set up this shop to earn my living and support my family.</p><h4 id=q-what-were-the-major-difficulties-you-faced-when-you-first-started>Q: What were the major difficulties you faced when you first started?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I think initially it was <strong>difficult to have a good customer base</strong> to make profit as there were a few existing stores in the area that people were familiar with. But we overcame that by offering a large variety of goods that the competitions were not distributing at the time. Now we have customers that have been coming to us for their everyday needs for the last 20 years in a row.</p><h4 id=q-what-is-your-role-in-the-shop>Q: What is your role in the shop?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I manage everything from the customers and vendors to keeping the space clean and welcoming.</p><h4 id=q-who-are-your-typical-customers>Q: Who are your typical customers?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I would say I recognize most of them as they are the <strong>residents of Indrapuri</strong> and have been shopping with us for years. It’s a mixed crowd of children, youngsters, adults, and senior citizens.</p><h4 id=q-what-are-your-top-priorities>Q: What are your top priorities?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> Definitely the <strong>needs of the customers</strong>. I always ensure that all the products are safe for consumption and of superior quality. Sometimes when we don’t have a product in store, I note them down to make it available for the customers in accordance with the demand.</p><h3 id=finances-and-banking>Finances and Banking</h3><img src=/img/kirana-kahani/day-life-kirana-merchant/finance.jpg width=80%><ol><li><p>- Laxman <strong>uses the POS terminal</strong> for accepting payments as it is more convenient for him as well as his customers especially during the time of this pandemic when people are weary of handling cash.</p></li><li><p>- He does not use the ATM and goes directly to the bank for the necessary transactions.</p></li><li><p>- He estimates that due to the current situation, the everyday transactions comprise of <strong>90% QR code payments</strong> and 10% cash payments.</p></li></ol><h4 id=q-do-you-use-a-pos-terminal-for-accepting-payments-if-yes-why-if-no-why-not>Q: Do you use a POS Terminal for accepting payments, if yes, why, if no, why not?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I have installed the POS terminal for the sake of convenience for accepting payments from my customers. Most of my customers avoid paying in cash and use cards to clear their payments. As the demand for card transactions rose, I had to install the system to keep up with the trend.</p><h4 id=q-what-is-the-percentage-of-cash-transactions-at-your-shop>Q. What is the percentage of cash transactions at your shop?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> The percentage of cash transactions in my shop is very low since most of my customers prefer the POS or online portals. Only about 10% of daily purchases are bought by cash.</p><h4 id=q-do-you-use-an-atm-why-do-you-withdraw-money-from-the-atm>Q. Do you use an ATM? Why do you withdraw money from the ATM?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> No, I do not use an ATM to withdraw cash. Whenever I require cash I directly go to the bank and withdraw money. I use the cash for running my household errands and paying my employees.</p><h4 id=q-how-did-you-manage-the-initial-capital>Q: How did you manage the initial capital?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> My father invested some amount from his savings and the rest I got from a loan that I paid off years back.</p><h4 id=q-have-you-registered-for-gst>Q: Have you registered for GST?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, I have registered for GST.</p><h3 id=online-portals>Online Portals</h3><img src=/img/kirana-kahani/day-life-kirana-merchant/online.jpg width=80%><ol><li><p>- Laxman does not use any other social apps apart from WhatsApp and prefers to spend his free time with his family instead of being on the phone.</p></li><li><p>- He accepts payments through online portals via UPI and QR codes.</p></li><li><p>- He keeps a record of customer and vendor payments through PayTM’s business app and a good old fashioned register.</p></li></ol><h4 id=q-which-apps-do-you-use-for-running-your-business>Q: Which apps do you use for running your business?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I use PayTM&rsquo;s business app to keep track of the UPI and QR payments. However, I also keep a register for accounting and tax. Sometimes I use WhatsApp for taking orders.</p><h4 id=q-do-you-accept-payments-through-online-portals-and-why>Q: Do you accept payments through online portals and why?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I accept payments through GPay, PhonePe and UPI including QR code payments. Most of the people in my locality use the online portal to pay for their goods. Given the usability and ease of transactions, the cashless market has certainly grown in demand. Therefore, I accept these forms of online payments.</p></article></div></div><div class=comments-area><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=text/javascript>(function(){if(window.location.hostname=="localhost")return;var dsq=document.createElement('script');dsq.type='text/javascript';dsq.async=true;var disqus_shortname='https-cashport-in';dsq.src='//'+disqus_shortname+'.disqus.com/embed.js';(document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]||document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq);})();</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href=https://disqus.com/ class=dsq-brlink>comments powered by <span class=logo-disqus>Disqus</span></a></div></div><div class=col-lg-4><div class=blog_right_sidebar><aside class="single_sidebar_widget post_category_widget"><h4 class=widget_title>Table of Contents</h4><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#a-day-in-the-life-of-a-businessman>A day in the life of a businessman</a><ul><li><a href=#business>Business</a></li><li><a href=#finances-and-banking>Finances and Banking</a></li><li><a href=#online-portals>Online Portals</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></aside><aside class="single_sidebar_widget tag_cloud_widget"><h4 class=widget_title>Tags</h4><ul class=list><div class=blog-tags><li><a href=https://cashport.in//tags/pos-terminal/>pos terminal</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href=https://cashport.in//tags/online-payment/>online payment</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href=https://cashport.in//tags/urban/>urban</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href=https://cashport.in//tags/technology-driven/>technology driven</a>&nbsp;</li></div></ul></aside></div></div></div></section><footer class="footer footer_bg_1"><div class=footer_top><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-xl-4 col-md-6 col-lg-4"><div class=footer_widget><div class=footer_logo><a href=#><img src=https://cashport.in/img/logo.png alt></a></div><p>CashPort helps you move your cash to your account by providing a
