And the sons of a small-time farmer began their journey of becoming what they are today - proud owners of the “Daily Fresh”. Ismail partnered with his brother Akbar to buy the shop in a housing complex perched in the Electronic City of Bangalore and set up his General Store in 2016.</p><p>Ismail, 55 yrs old now, lives with his wife, three kids and his family. The two brothers pooled their savings to buy the shop from the previous owner and fortunately never had to borrow money from the bank. Right now, his main competition is the three other shops that deal in similar FMCG goods.</p><h3 id=business>Business</h3><img src=/img/kirana-kahani/farmer-tactics-kirana-merchant/cashport.jpg width=80%><ol><li><p>- Mr. Ismail and Mr. Akbar are the owners of their general store “Daily Fresh” which is located in the clubhouse of a housing society called Concorde Manhattans in the Electronic City area of Bengaluru.</p></li><li><p>- The shop deals with FMCG products as well as other home needs such as vegetables.

My father used to be a small-time farmer, but after his small leg accident, it became difficult for him to continue work. While he still pushed on, I decided to skip college and start this business.</p><h4 id=q-when-did-you-start-your-business>Q: When did you start your business?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> We started the business in 2016.</p><h4 id=q-what-does-your-business-deal-with-and-who-are-your-typical-customers>Q: What does your business deal with and who are your typical customers??</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> The shop deals with FMCG products as well as other home needs such as vegetables. Right before the COVID pandemic, we had started selling toys as well. Residents of the society are my only customers.</p><h4 id=q-what-were-the-major-difficulties-in-running-your-business>Q: What were the major difficulties in running your business?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> The main problem is the small customer base but the large variance in taste. As we operate inside a society, we can’t have customers from outside. Even then, everyone has so many needs and wants that we have to keep a lot of SKUs. Another issue is the issue of shop-lifting. Kids we can handle easily, but sometimes even the adults indulge in it. It is very tough to confront the residents that way. Lastly, we also have 3 other major three stores that are bigger than us. Competing with them is also a major challenge.</p><h4 id=q-do-you-get-help-from-your-family-members-how-many-support-staff-have-you-hired>Q: Do you get help from your family members? How many support staff have you hired?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, I do. My brother is my partner and looks after the shop alongside me. Apart from him, I have my two other cousins helping me out. I have 6 staff working with me in total. Three girls and two boys that run the billing counters and do the stocking. The boys also make home deliveries. Apart from them, I have 1 amma who helps in keeping the shop clean.</p><h4 id=q-for-the-most-of-the-time-you-are-in-the-shop-what-do-you-do>Q: For the most of the time, you are in the shop. What do you do?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> For most of the time, I sit in a corner of my shop and supervise and aid the support staff. I also keep the ledgers and stock inventories up to date and place orders as necessary.</p><h4 id=q-what-are-your-top-priorities>Q: What are your top priorities?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> The number one thing is to make sure that the business stays safe and afloat. I have to make sure that I can feed my family and give my kids a better education than what I received.</p><h3 id=finance-and-banking>Finance and Banking</h3><img src=/img/kirana-kahani/farmer-tactics-kirana-merchant/finance.png width=80%><ol><li><p>- The two brothers pooled in their savings and bought the store from the previous owner to set up his shop.</p></li><li><p>- He never took any loans from the bank but often uses credit to stock his supplies.</p></li><li><p>- He has registered for GST and makes a profit of around ₹500,000 from his store.</p></li></ol><h4 id=q-how-did-you-manage-the-initial-capital>Q: How did you manage the initial capital?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> We pooled in our savings and bought the previous shop in the place to begin with.</p><h4 id=q-do-you-use-a-posterminal-for-accepting-payments-if-yes-why-if-no-why-not>Q: Do you use a POS?Terminal for accepting payments, if yes, why, if no, why not?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I have a couple of POS terminal options for the customers to choose from. Since, nowadays everything is digital, POS terminals are a must keep up with the recent market. Everyone has a card so I’ll be missing quite a bit of revenue or be forced to give many credit lines, so it makes sense to have them.’</p><h4 id=q-what-is-the-age-of-cash-transactions-at-your-shop>Q: What is the %age of cash transactions at your shop?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> The total volume of a cash transaction is roughly 30%.</p><h4 id=q-do-you-use-the-atm-why-do-you-withdraw-money-from-the-atm>Q: Do you use the ATM? Why do you withdraw money from the ATM?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I Use the ATM for primarily paying the salaries and paying for small good deliveries. Given the ATM is placed inside the society, it is quite convenient for me to cover some deals in cash.</p><h4 id=q-how-much-money-do-you-make-in-a-month>Q: How much money do you make in a month?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> The shop has a profit of about ₹500,000 a month.
