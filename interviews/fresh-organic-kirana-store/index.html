Being the only earning member, he decided to start a business in 2012 to improve his financial condition. Instead of just keeping the money from the provident fund in a safe box, Nirav decided to invest it in establishing his groceries store in Surat. The hardwork and risks paid off and soon his shop was the ultimate destination for the localities seeking fresh vegetables.</p><p>Nirav lives with his family of five, wife, mother and two children. He keeps his profit margins low and vegetables fresh which ensures customer retention. His shop always has 2 to 3 customers waiting in line and a minimum sale of ₹5000/day. He uses the power of the internet to advertise his shop and reach new customers.</p><h3 id=business>Business</h3><img src=/img/kirana-kahani/fresh-organic-kirana-store/cashport.jpg width=80%><ol><li><p>- Nirav Chaudhary, started his business back in 2012 to improve his family’s financial condition after he took an early retirement.</p></li><li><p>- His store has groceries at a comparatively low price with assured quality and quantity so he always has 2-3 waiting customers at his shop.</p></li><li><p>- Nirav decided to invest the money from his provident fund in establishing his groceries store in Surat.</p></li><li><p>- He has one person working under him to help him manage his shop.</p></li></ol><h4 id=q-why-did-you-start-this-business->Q: Why did you start this business ?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I started this business to live a better life and to improve my family’s financial condition. But the primary driving force was the will to give my kids a good education and therefore, a good life.</p><h4 id=q-when-did-you-start-his-business>Q: When did you start his business?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I started the business back in 2012 when I took an early retirement from my 9-5 job. I was rendered weak from an unfortunate accident that made me unable to carry on with the travel. I had to voluntarily leave the job and that is when I started this business to provide for my family.</p><h4 id=q-what-does-your-business-deal-with>Q: What does your business deal with?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> My shop primarily deals with vegetables and fruits. My store has groceries at a comparatively low price with assured quality and quantity so that ensures I always have 2-3 waiting customers in line.</p><h4 id=q-what-were-the-major-difficulties-in-running-the-business>Q: What were the major difficulties in running the business?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I faced many difficulties initially like not getting a single customer in a day but I didn’t give up. Instead I started working harder and smarter. I started advertising online, made door to door deliveries and gathered the trust of my customers eventually. I also face heavy competition from two bigger shops in the locality. Another challenge is handling the customers who typically bargain and are short tempered.</p><h4 id=q-do-you-get-help-from-your-family-members-have-you-hired-any-support>Q: Do you get help from your family members? Have you hired any support?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> My family always supported me even though I wasn’t earning much initially. When I was out delivering groceries, my wife or mother took care of the store. However, now I earn enough to hire a support. I have one person working under me who helps me manage the shop.</p><h4 id=q-for-the-most-time-in-the-shop-what-do-you-do>Q: For the most time in the shop, what do you do?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> Most of the time I am in the store I listen to music or complete the pending work.

I try to keep the prices low but never compromise on the quality of my goods. My typical customers are the people from the nearby localities.</p><h4 id=q-what-do-you-do-in-your-free-time>Q: What do you do in your free time?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> In my free time I usually return home to spend time with my family, watch television or resort to the newspaper. I spend my off days with my family by picnicking, camping, and playing games.</p><h3 id=finance-and-banking>Finance and Banking</h3><img src=/img/kirana-kahani/fresh-organic-kirana-store/finance.jpg width=80%><ol><li><p>- The initial investment for the store was gathered from the money that came from his provident fund.
