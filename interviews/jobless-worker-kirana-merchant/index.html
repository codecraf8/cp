Arun is a victim of the economic depression after demonetization. He <strong>lost his ad hoc job</strong> but refused to define his life with one bad incident. He gathered all his savings, a meagre 15000, to set up the general store and put his heart to it. In a few years time, it became one of the most sought after stores in the locality. He relates his shop to the deity Shiva, for it takes care of his family like Shiva takes care of all life on Earth.</p><p>Arun lives with his wife Usha, son Ujjwal, and two daughters, Priya and Supriya. His store <strong>deals with the usual FMCG items</strong> sold by all general stores. In addition to that, he also sells fresh vegetables, and frozen nuts and chocolates.</p><h3 id=business>Business</h3><img src=/img/kirana-kahani/jobless-worker-kirana-merchant/cashport.jpg width=80%><ol><li><p>- Arun started his business around four years ago when he lost his ad hoc job due to the economic turmoil of demonetization.

Shivgun means the gunas or attributes of Shiva, the God of destruction in the Hindu trinity; I wanted my shop to take care of my family’s needs the way Shiva takes care of this world. My shop is <strong>located in Hehal in the city of Ranchi</strong>, and there are different colonies and localities around it. The locality has a mix of people from rural and urban backgrounds.</p><h4 id=q-why-and-when-did-you-start-your-business>Q: Why and when did you start your business?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I started my business around four years ago, after I lost my ad hoc job due to the economic turmoil of demonetization. Since then this shop has been the source of my livelihood for my entire family, and it has served us well. My business is now the sole means of earning in my family.</p><h4 id=q-what-does-your-business-deal-with>Q: What does your business deal with?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> Since I have a small business, I try to stock little quantities of most of the items I can. My <strong>shop sells the usual FMCG items</strong> you will find in most general stores. Generally, I try to keep small quantities of different items, and bring larger quantities only when demanded by customers. If any customer asks for a particular product, I note it down and get it from the wholesale market the next time I go for my purchases.<strong>I also sell fresh vegetables</strong> at my store, and frozen nuts and chocolates.</p><h4 id=q-how-did-you-manage-the-initial-capital>Q: How did you manage the initial capital?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> The initial capital was not much, we had lost all income sources and started this business with a meagre sum of about 15,000 rupees from my past savings. I have <strong>never borrowed money from people</strong> for my business, and am very grateful to the almighty.</p><h4 id=q-what-were-the-major-difficulties-in-running-your-business>Q: What were the major difficulties in running your business?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> The only <strong>difficulty is the stiff competition</strong>, there are about nine general stores in the surrounding locality and each one has its own loyal customer base; and ever since the Reliance Market has opened at a short distance, the customers have been preferring that to the limited products we are able to supply. Apart from that, most of the residents are office workers, and they get their shopping done in the bigger shops and marts in the heart of the city.</p><h4 id=q-do-you-get-help-from-your-family-members>Q: Do you get help from your family members?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> Mostly I don’t need or rely on support from my family members. Sometimes my wife gives me a respite of an hour or two in the afternoon, or when I go out to buy the stock. My son sits with me in the shop in the evening, and also accompanies me in dealing with the vendors and restocking the supply.</p><h4 id=q-how-much-support-have-you-hired>Q: How much support have you hired?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I have <strong>never hired any support</strong>. I have a small business, and whenever I am unwell, or busy elsewhere, my family steps in to look out for me.</p><h4 id=q-for-most-of-the-time-you-are-in-the-shop-what-do-you-do>Q: For most of the time you are in the shop, what do you do?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I don’t really have much to do, I am mostly busy in the shop or in dealing with different vendors and suppliers. Whenever I have some free time, I like to read the newspaper and talk to people who have shops alongside mine.</p><h4 id=q-what-are-your-top-priorities>Q: What are your top priorities?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> My top priority is <strong>just to keep the shop running well</strong>, like I said, it is the sole means of earning for my family. I also would like to expand the shop, and do something for my son.</p><h4 id=q-who-are-your-typical-customers>Q: Who are your typical customers?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> My typical customers are residents of the surrounding localities. Mostly everyone likes to go to the shop but there is one locality that does not have any general store, so they come to mine. Also, I sell vegetables, so people who go out for morning walks generally come to my shop for the fresh vegetables.</p><h4 id=q-what-do-you-do-in-your-free-time>Q: What do you do in your free time?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I don’t have much free time. <strong>I open my shop at 6:00 a.m.</strong> in the morning and remain here till I close it around 8:30 to 9:00 p.m.. The mornings and evenings are rush hours, and I prefer to have dinner and go to bed after I go home. Sometimes, I like to listen to old Hindi songs that my daughters play for me, I especially love Mohammed Rafi. Apart from that, there is no leisure that life has afforded me so far.</p><h3 id=finance-and-business>Finance and Business</h3><img src=/img/kirana-kahani/jobless-worker-kirana-merchant/finance.jpg width=80%><ol><li><p>- Arun used his savings of a meagre 15000 as his initial investment to set up his shop when he lost his job.</p></li><li><p>- He doesn’t use any POS terminal because he doesn’t understand english. Most of his customers also don’t understand the language, and therefore the need never arose.</p></li><li><p>- He also does not have any debit or credit card and has opened a bank account only very recently.</p></li><li><p>-He sometimes buys his products on a credit and is given a period of 10 days to return the money.</p></li></ol><h4 id=q-do-you-use-a-pos-terminal-for-accepting-payments-if-yes-why-if-no-why-not>Q: Do you use a POS Terminal for accepting payments, if yes, why, if no, why not?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I don’t use any POS terminal, nor do I use any other form of payment other than cash. See, I am <strong>not very educated</strong>, and I cannot speak or read English, nor is my locality such that people would prefer to use online payment or app payment. My business is conventional and I live with traditional people, so we <strong>don’t use these new payment methods.</strong></p><h4 id=q-what-is-the-age-of-cash-transactions-at-your-shop>Q: What is the %age of cash transactions at your shop?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> All mine transactions are in the cash mode, like I said, I don’t accept payments in any other form, nor would I be comfortable in using any other form of money other than cash.</p><h4 id=q-what-is-the-age-of-qr-code-payments-at-your-shop>Q: What is the %age of QR code payments at your shop?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> There are no QR code payments at my shop, there are <strong>only cash transactions.</strong></p><h4 id=q-do-you-use-an-atm-why-do-you-withdraw-money-from-the-atm>Q: Do you use an ATM? Why do you withdraw money from the ATM?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I <strong>don’t use an ATM card</strong>, in fact, I didn’t have a bank account until very recently. The only bank account I have currently is the <strong>Jan Dhan account I recently opened</strong> in the nearby bank.</p><h4 id=q-how-much-money-do-you-make-in-a-month>Q: How much money do you make in a month?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> It is difficult to say that to be honest. I have even <strong>incurred losses sometimes</strong>, especially due to the vegetables. There have been times, especially before the lockdown when I would buy the vegetables and no one would buy them from me. Generally I earn enough to take care of my family’s needs, and no matter what we adjust our requirements but have never asked money from anyone ever.</p><h4 id=q-did-you-take-any-loan-from-external-people-for-running-your-shop-if-yes-what-is-the-interest-you-pay>Q: Did you take any loan from external people for running your shop? If yes, what is the interest you pay?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I have never taken any loan to run my business, I have a small business that I set up with my meagre savings, and I do not have any big ambitions from my shop. I don’t think I will ever take a loan in the future, business or otherwise. I bring all my supplies from the bigger wholesale market in the city, and mostly make payments in cash. A few times, I have asked for credit and I <strong>was given a credit period of ten days</strong>.</p><h4 id=q-how-do-you-repay-your-loan---upi--cash--cheque--online>Q: How do you repay your loan - UPI / Cash / Cheque / Online?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> Since I have never taken a loan yet, there’s no point.</p><h4 id=q-have-you-registered-for-gst>Q: Have you registered for GST?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> No, I have <strong>not registered for GST</strong>, and in future shall my shop grow and diversify to fall in that range, I will certainly register for GST.</p><h4 id=q-how-much-do-you-pay-monthly-for-electricity-phone-gas-shop-rent>Q: How much do you pay monthly for electricity, phone, gas, shop-rent?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I pay 3,000 rupees for the shop rent, and a few hundred rupees for the electricity bill. There are not many payments that I have to make, and I make all my payments in cash.</p><h3 id=online-portals>Online Portals</h3><img src=/img/kirana-kahani/jobless-worker-kirana-merchant/online.jpg width=80%><ol><li><p>- Arun does not use any online portals for transactions since he does not own a smartphone.</p></li><li><p>- He sticks to traditional methods of bookkeeping using only a calculator.</p></li></ol><h4 id=q-what-are-the-apps-you-use-for-running-your-business>Q: What are the apps you use for running your business?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I don’t use any app in running my business, the only tool I use is a simple manual calculator; and I <strong>don’t even own a smartphone</strong>.</p><h4 id=q-what-apps-do-you-otherwise-use>Q: What apps do you otherwise use?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I don’t use any apps, like I said I don’t own a smartphone and am <strong>not really comfortable with technology or gadgets</strong>. I use the traditional forms of bookkeeping and entertainment.</p></article></div></div><br><br><br><h4>You might also want to read :</h4><br><ul><li><a href=/interviews/traditional-kirana-merchant/><h5>A Quaint Shop in a Quaint Town</h5></a></li><li><a href=/interviews/office-worker-kiranan-merchant/><h5>From an Office Worker to a Kiranan Merchant</h5></a></li><li><a href=/interviews/farmer-tactics-kirana-merchant/><h5>Business Tactics From a Farmer’s Son</h5></a></li><li><a href=/interviews/female-perspective-kirana-merchant/><h5>A Woman’s Take on Business Tactics</h5></a></li><li><a href=/interviews/day-life-kirna-merchant/><h5>A Day in the Life of a Kirna Merchant</h5></a></li><li><a href=/cash-management-services/><h5>Cash Management Services</h5></a></li><li><a href=/cash-on-delivery-india/><h5>Cash on Delivery India</h5></a></li></ul><div class=comments-area><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=text/javascript>(function(){if(window.location.hostname=="localhost")return;var dsq=document.createElement('script');dsq.type='text/javascript';dsq.async=true;var disqus_shortname='https-cashport-in';dsq.src='//'+disqus_shortname+'.disqus.com/embed.js';(document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]||document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq);})();</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href=https://disqus.com/ class=dsq-brlink>comments powered by <span class=logo-disqus>Disqus</span></a></div></div><div class=col-lg-4><div class=blog_right_sidebar><aside class="single_sidebar_widget post_category_widget"><h4 class=widget_title>Table of Contents</h4><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#backstory>Backstory</a></li><li><a href=#business>Business</a></li><li><a href=#finance-and-business>Finance and Business</a></li><li><a href=#online-portals>Online Portals</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></aside><aside class="single_sidebar_widget post_category_widget"><h4>Related Articles</h4><br><ul><li>- <a style=margin-top:35px href=/interviews/traditional-kirana-merchant/>A Quaint Shop in a Quaint Town</a></li><li>- <a style=margin-top:35px href=/interviews/office-worker-kiranan-merchant/>From an Office Worker to a Kiranan Merchant</a></li><li>- <a style=margin-top:35px href=/interviews/farmer-tactics-kirana-merchant/>Business Tactics From a Farmer’s Son</a></li><li>- <a style=margin-top:35px href=/interviews/female-perspective-kirana-merchant/>A Woman’s Take on Business Tactics</a></li><li>- <a style=margin-top:35px href=/interviews/day-life-kirna-merchant/>A Day in the Life of a Kirna Merchant</a></li><li>- <a style=margin-top:35px href=/cash-management-services/>Cash Management Services</a></li><li>- <a style=margin-top:35px href=/cash-on-delivery-india/>Cash on Delivery India</a></li></ul></aside><aside class="single_sidebar_widget tag_cloud_widget"><h4 class=widget_title>Tags</h4><ul class=list><div class=blog-tags><li><a href=https://cashport.in//tags/cash/>cash</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href=https://cashport.in//tags/traditional/>traditional</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href=https://cashport.in//tags/urban/>urban</a>&nbsp;</li></div></ul></aside></div></div></div></section><footer class="footer footer_bg_1"><div class=footer_top><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-xl-4 col-md-6 col-lg-4"><div class=footer_widget><div class=footer_logo><a href=#><img src=https://cashport.in/img/logo.png alt></a></div><p>CashPort helps you move your cash to your account by providing a
