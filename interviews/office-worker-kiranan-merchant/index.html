With a little support from his family and a lot of hard work, his general store was soon up and running. 9 years later, 28-years-old Devender Thakur is the proud owner of a very profitable N.H. General Store, perched in the outskirts of Delhi. Devender does not dwell in unnecessary brand tie-ups or traders associations, instead he believes in ensuring that no customer returns unsatisfied. With his wit and aesthetic ideas, he knew just how to attract customers and retain them.</p><p>Devender lives with his parents, his two younger sisters, a younger brother and his wife in a small town in Delhi. He spends most of his time in the store and manages everything alone with a little help from his wife. His father helps him out financially whenever required and so he never had to depend on loans.</p><h3 id=business>Business</h3><img src=/img/kirana-kahani/office-worker-kiranan-merchant/cashport.png width=80%><ol><li><p>- Devender started his business at a very young age with a little financial help from his father. He has never needed to take any loan to support his business. He also looks after his business single handedly without hiring help.</p></li><li><p>- Devender does not rely on any brand tie-ups or traders association as he believes customer satisfaction can be achieved only with the best quality goods and a little empathy.</p></li><li><p>- He does not intend to take his business online for all his customers are right in his locality and he does not need to find customers online.</p></li><li><p>- His competitive advantage was in his wits and he knew exactly how to attract and retain his customers. His top most priority is to maintain the quality of the goods.</p></li></ol><h4 id=q-why-did-you-transition-from-office-to-business>Q: Why did you transition from office to business?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I decided to start my business 9 years back when I was left unsatisfied and exhausted with the 9-to-5 job. After one and half years of office life, I realised my dream of becoming a businessman with the inauguration of the N. H. general store. There has been no looking back for me since then. My store is now one of the most sought after in the locality.</p><h4 id=q-what-does-your-business-deal-with-and-who-are-the-typical-customers>Q: What does your business deal with and who are the typical customers??</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> My business deals with all kinds of general items which are required in day to day life along with stationary items and photocopying documents. My typical customers include people from the neighbouring societies who take regular visits at the store and rely upon me completely.</p><h4 id=q-what-were-the-major-difficulties-in-running-your-business>Q: What were the major difficulties in running your business?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> Fortunately enough, I never faced any major difficulty in this business. To make the shop more presentable, I redecorated its interior and exterior, so it would look distinctively different and better than my rivals. This made the shop even more appealing and soon I outdid all local competitors. I tend to deliver customer satisfaction with quality goods and quality relationships.</p><h4 id=q-do-you-get-any-help-from-your-family-members-how-much-support-have-you-hired>Q: Do you get any help from your family members? How much support have you hired?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I never had to hire any support for my store. I have worked hard and managed all the shopkeeping errands mostly on my own. However, without the support of my family, I would not have made it so far. My family has been kind enough to provide me with all the mental and physical aid I needed along the way.</p><h4 id=q-what-does-your-working-schedule-look-like-and-what-do-you-do-in-your-free-time>Q: What does your working schedule look like and what do you do in your free time?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I open my shop very early in the morning at 7 am. The most busy hours are 7 to 11 am and 6 to 9 pm, which are spent dealing with customers. When free, I indulge in mobile games to pass time and as a means of relaxation. I am also a travel enthusiast and long drives are my favourite. Whenever I am free from my routine, I pick up my bike and take it for a spin on the highways. For me, it is the best way to rejuvenate my mind before getting back to work.</p><h4 id=q-what-are-your-top-priorities-with-regard-to-the-business>Q: What are your top priorities with regard to the business?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I believe any successful business is driven by customer satisfaction. My priority is in maintaining quality goods and quality behavior over everything else. My customers shop with me not only for maintaining quality but also for providing them with the best market price.</p><h3 id=finance-and-banking>Finance and Banking</h3><img src=/img/kirana-kahani/office-worker-kiranan-merchant/finance.png width=80%><ol><li><p>- Devender owns a single bank account for savings and does not use it much for transactions. He only uses the ATM in cases of any emergency since most of his transactions are dealt in cash.</p></li><li><p>- He was fortunate to have his father’s help for any financial help he required even during the initial period. The store was opened with his father’s savings and he never felt the need to take any loans from the bank.</p></li><li><p>- Although he deals mostly in cash, Devender introduced UPI payments to meet customer demands after demonetization.</p></li></ol><h4 id=q-what-is-the-age-of-cash-transactions-at-your-shop>Q: What is the %age of cash transactions at your shop?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> Most of my transactions are dealt in cash, however, I realised the need for accepting UPI payments after demonetization. Many regular customers asked for online payment portals and since then I have been accepting both cash and online payments. About 65% of all transactions are dealt in cash in my store.</p><h4 id=q-do-you-use-an-atm-to-withdraw-money>Q: Do you use an ATM to withdraw money?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I rarely have the need to withdraw money from the bank since most of my transactions are dealt in cash. I only visit the ATM if there is an emergency requirement of cash. The last time I visited the ATM was 7 to 8 months back when my brother had a serious injury.</p><h4 id=q-how-did-you-manage-with-the-initial-capital-did-you-take-loans-from-external-people-for-running-the-shop-if-yes-what-is-the-interest-he-pays>Q: How did you manage with the initial capital? Did you take loans from external people for running the shop? If yes, what is the interest he pays.</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I have been fortunate enough to have my father provide me with any financial help I needed. Therefore I never had to rely on the banks or any other external people for monetary support for my business. I never took any loans from neither the bank nor outside to start my business. The store was opened with my father’s savings and I have always had his support to rely on during the initial difficult times. I am certainly proud that I managed to make it a success without any debts or external support.</p><h4 id=q-how-much-do-you-make-in-a-month-how-much-do-you-pay-monthly-for-electricity-phone-gas-shop-rent>Q: How much do you make in a month? How much do you pay monthly for electricity, phone, gas, shop-rent?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> My profits range from 50,000 to 60,000 per month depending on the season. My phone, electricity and gas bills roundup about 6000 per month. I do not have to pay any rent because I own the shop which is attached to my house. Hence, I do not have any travel expenses either.</p><h3 id=online-portals>Online Portals</h3><img src=/img/kirana-kahani/office-worker-kiranan-merchant/online.png width=80%><ol><li><p>- Being a millennial and a gaming enthusiast, Devender is not far behind his times. He accepts payments from his customers through all popular online portals and leaves no aspect for complaining.</p></li><li><p>- Devender uses Khatabook to keep his transactions free from human error and up-to-date.</p></li><li><p>- He takes full help of the digital interfaces of PhonePe, PayTm and other popular transaction portals to keep up with the customer demands.</p></li></ol><h4 id=q-what-is-the-age-of-qr-code-payments-at-your-shop>Q. What is the %age of QR code payments at your shop?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> 35% of all transactions in my shop are done through scanning QR code. To be honest, there isn’t any area online payments have not infiltrated and given its benefits, I am most comfortable dealing with digital transactions.</p><h4 id=q-do-you-use-a-pos-terminal-for-accepting-payments-if-yes-why-if-no-why-not>Q. Do you use a POS Terminal for accepting payments, if yes, why, if no, why not?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, I accept payments through PhonePe, PayTM, Amazon Pay, other UPI apps, and all types of electronic payment methods including QR Code. Most of the younger generation customers use the digital interface or card transactions for payment.</p><h4 id=q-what-are-the-apps-you-use-for-running-the-business-what-apps-do-you-use-otherwise>Q. What are the apps you use for running the business? What apps do you use otherwise?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I use apps like KhataBook and WhatsApp to manage my expenses, keep track of transactions and to interact with my customers. Other than business dealings, I use all social media apps for personal engagements. I often spend my free time playing mobile games Call Of Duty: Mobile and Need for Speed to relax my mind.</p></article></div></div><br><br><br><h4>You might also want to read :</h4><br><ul><li><a href=/interviews/female-perspective-kirana-merchant/><h5>A Woman’s Take on Business Tactics</h5></a></li><li><a href=/interviews/tale-devoted-kirna-merchant/><h5>The Tale of a Devoted Kirna Merchant</h5></a></li><li><a href=/interviews/day-life-kirna-merchant/><h5>A Day in the Life of a Kirna Merchant</h5></a></li><li><a href=/interviews/farmer-tactics-kirana-merchant/><h5>Business Tactics From a Farmer’s Son</h5></a></li><li><a href=/interviews/traditional-kirana-merchant/><h5>A Quaint Shop in a Quaint Town</h5></a></li><li><a href=/cash-management-services/><h5>Cash Management Services</h5></a></li><li><a href=/cash-on-delivery-india/><h5>Cash on Delivery India</h5></a></li></ul><div class=comments-area><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=text/javascript>(function(){if(window.location.hostname=="localhost")return;var dsq=document.createElement('script');dsq.type='text/javascript';dsq.async=true;var disqus_shortname='https-cashport-in';dsq.src='//'+disqus_shortname+'.disqus.com/embed.js';(document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]||document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq);})();</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href=https://disqus.com/ class=dsq-brlink>comments powered by <span class=logo-disqus>Disqus</span></a></div></div><div class=col-lg-4><div class=blog_right_sidebar><aside class="single_sidebar_widget post_category_widget"><h4 class=widget_title>Table of Contents</h4><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li></li><li><a href=#backstory>Backstory</a></li><li><a href=#business>Business</a></li><li><a href=#finance-and-banking>Finance and Banking</a></li><li><a href=#online-portals>Online Portals</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></aside><aside class="single_sidebar_widget post_category_widget"><h4>Related Articles</h4><br><ul><li>- <a style=margin-top:35px href=/interviews/female-perspective-kirana-merchant/>A Woman’s Take on Business Tactics</a></li><li>- <a style=margin-top:35px href=/interviews/tale-devoted-kirna-merchant/>The Tale of a Devoted Kirna Merchant</a></li><li>- <a style=margin-top:35px href=/interviews/day-life-kirna-merchant/>A Day in the Life of a Kirna Merchant</a></li><li>- <a style=margin-top:35px href=/interviews/farmer-tactics-kirana-merchant/>Business Tactics From a Farmer’s Son</a></li><li>- <a style=margin-top:35px href=/interviews/traditional-kirana-merchant/>A Quaint Shop in a Quaint Town</a></li><li>- <a style=margin-top:35px href=/cash-management-services/>Cash Management Services</a></li><li>- <a style=margin-top:35px href=/cash-on-delivery-india/>Cash on Delivery India</a></li></ul></aside><aside class="single_sidebar_widget tag_cloud_widget"><h4 class=widget_title>Tags</h4><ul class=list><div class=blog-tags><li><a href=https://cashport.in//tags/cash/>cash</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href=https://cashport.in//tags/online-payment/>online payment</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href=https://cashport.in//tags/pos-terminal/>pos terminal</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href=https://cashport.in//tags/technology-driven/>technology driven</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href=https://cashport.in//tags/rural/>rural</a>&nbsp;</li></div></ul></aside></div></div></div></section><footer class="footer footer_bg_1"><div class=footer_top><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-xl-4 col-md-6 col-lg-4"><div class=footer_widget><div class=footer_logo><a href=#><img src=https://cashport.in/img/logo.png alt></a></div><p>CashPort helps you move your cash to your account by providing a
