He runs a small Kirana Store in the Khanderao Market, Vadodara, Gujarat. His shop is perched in the heart of the city. Jignesh stays with his wife, son & his daughter-in-law in his 2 story building apartment just above his store. He runs this family-owned business with full involvement from his wife & his son. He is a devoted businessman who has been sitting on the cash counter since age 15.</p><p>The name of his store is Lankavala Pannalal Chotalal, the namesake of his family Surname. Although his father, who is the original owner of this shop, is no more physically present, his essence lingers on. He considers his father as an idol and the whole and sole owner of this place. Jignesh is thankful to his father who started this business and took it to such heights of success. Chotalal used to worship his Kirana store like a goddess, says Jignesh and it is a heritage he shall carry forward.</p><h3 id=basic-details>Basic Details</h3><h4 id=q-what-is-your-name-and-age>Q. What is your name and age?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> My full name is Jignesh Chotalal Lankawala and I am 55 yrs old.</p><h4 id=q-what-is-the-name-of-the-shop-and-locality>Q. What is the name of the shop and locality?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I run a Kirana store in the heart of the city Vadodara- opposite to the Khanderao market. The name of the Kirana store is Lankavala Pannalal Chotalal, which has been named after my family name.</p><h4 id=q-who-are-the-members-of-your-family>Q. Who are the members of your family?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> My family consists of a total of four people, my wife, son & daughter-in-law.</p><h4 id=q-what-is-your-operational-time>Q: What is your operational time?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I open the shop sharp at 8 am in the morning & close at 9 pm. I manage the shop from 8 a.m. to 12 pm along with my son. At around 12 pm, my wife comes down & sits on the cash counter, while we take a lunch break. I come down at 3 pm, after a short nap & stay in the store at a stretch till 9 pm.</p><h3 id=business>Business</h3><img src=/img/kirana-kahani/tale-devoted-kirana-merchant/cashport.jpg width=80%><ol><li><p>- The store was established by Jignesh’s father Chotalal long before he was born. It has been in function for around 75 to 80 years now.</p></li><li><p>- Their store sells all consumer goods. It also deals with all FMCG goods under one roof.</p></li><li><p>- His typical customers are from the surrounding locality.</p></li><li><p>- The most busy hours are from 9 am to 12 pm and between 5 pm to 9 pm.</p></li></ol><h4 id=q-why-did-you-start-your-business>Q: Why did you start your business?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> This store is in fact far older than me. My father started this business because after coming back from his native village Anand, Gujarat he didn’t want to continue farming. I reckon that an escape from farming was the reason behind the establishment of our store.The store I own is around 75-80 years old & was <strong>started by my father Chotalal</strong> at a very young age.</p><h4 id=q-when-did-you-start-your-business>Q: When did you start your business?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> Chotalal Lankawala, my father, started this business some 75-80 years ago when he was young before I was born.</p><h4 id=q-what-does-your-business-deal-with>Q: What does your business deal with?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> Lankavala Pannalal Chotalal is a Kirana store that sells all consumer goods. It deals with all <strong>FMCG goods under one roof.</strong></p><h4 id=q-what-were-the-major-difficulties-in-running-your-business>Q: What were the major difficulties in running your business?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> The big departmental stores have hampered my businesses directly. Customers prefer big departmental stores like D-mart, More Megastore, etc above local Kirana stores. But the lockdown due to the virus has had its positive impact on my business. Because of the pandemic, customers now prefer local over departmental stores.</p><h4 id=qdo-you-get-help-from-your-family-members>Q:Do you get help from your family members?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I am very grateful for the support I get from my wife & son. Recently, my son has taken a keen interest in learning the business inside-out and is looking forward to taking up the legacy whenever I decide to retire. The shop is never kept left with just the workers. One of the other family members is always there.</p><h4 id=qhow-much-support-have-you-hired>Q:How much support have you hired?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I have hired 2 additional workers for operational support during peak hours.</p><h4 id=qmost-of-the-time-you-are-in-the-shop-what-do-you-do--what-do-you-do-in-your-free-time>Q:Most of the time you are in the shop what do you do & What do you do in your free time?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I hardly get any free time in my day time, as my shop is always flooded with customers. If I get some, then I check for our stock of food products, inventories, accounting, cash balance & other things. The most busy hours are from 9 am to 12 pm and are comparatively silent in the afternoon. Additionally, the second wave of peak hours are also seen between 5 pm to 9 pm.Often the store is kept open until 10 pm due to a heavy rush.</p><h4 id=qwhat-are-your-top-priorities-and-who-are-your-typical-customers>Q:What are your top priorities and who are your typical customers?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I treat all customers with the same value. I do not discriminate while selling. A customer buying goods of Rs 10 is equivalent to a customer buying goods of Rs 3000 for me. Their satisfaction is my top priority. The customers coming to the Kirana store are majorly from the surrounding localities.</p><h3 id=finance-and-banking>Finance and Banking:</h3><img src=/img/kirana-kahani/tale-devoted-kirana-merchant/finance.jpg width=80%><ol><li><p>- The initial investment was made by Jignesh’s father Chotalal by selling his inherited agricultural land.

The exact amount of initial investment is unknown but it was financed after selling inherited agricultural land.</p><h4 id=qdo-you-use-a-pos-terminal-for-accepting-payments-if-yes-why-if-no-why-not>Q:Do you use a POS Terminal for accepting payments, if yes, why, if no, why not?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, I use a POS Terminal & accept all types of card payments. I have been using the POS system for the past 6-7 years. Almost 50% of my customers use the POS terminal for making payments. My son has played an important role in introducing me to the vast benefits of technology.</p><h4 id=qwhat-is-the-percentage-of-cash-transactions-at-your-shop>Q:What is the percentage of cash transactions at your shop?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> Cash transactions have gradually reduced to 25-30% over the years. Customers prefer UPI or card payments over cash whenever the bill is above 500. Cash transactions are more in quantities but in monetary value, the percentage contribution to the turnover is very less.</p><h4 id=qdo-you-use-an-atm-why-do-you-withdraw-money-from-the-atm>Q:Do you use an ATM? Why do you withdraw money from the ATM?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I use an ATM card to withdraw cash, only when I have to pay my suppliers. The frequency of going to ATM machines is very less.</p><h4 id=qhow-much-money-do-you-make-in-a-month>Q:How much money do you make in a month?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> The approximate revenue per month, after deducting all the expenses is around Rs 1,00,000. The revenues have increased after my son joined the business. My son picks up the inventory most of the time from the supplier. He maintains a good relationship with them and eventually high discounts on bulk orders are procured.</p><h4 id=qdo-you-take-any-loans-from-external-people-for-running-your-shop-if-yes-what-is-the-interest-you-pay>Q:Do you take any loans from external people for running your shop?

I have been fortunate enough to not have to take any loan.</p><h4 id=qhave-you-registered-for-gst>Q:Have you registered for GST?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> As most of the suppliers have their GSTIN number, I have also registered for the same to get cash credit. Thus making it a GST registered Kirana store.</p><h4 id=qhow-much-do-you-pay-monthly-for-electricity-phone-gas-and-shop-rent>Q:How much do you pay monthly for electricity, phone, gas, and shop-rent?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I pay Rs 2000 monthly for the electricity bills. The shop is owned by me so there is no shop rent. There is also not any gas connection to pay for the same.</p><h3 id=online-portals>Online Portals</h3><img src=/img/kirana-kahani/tale-devoted-kirana-merchant/online.jpg width=80%><ol><li><p>- He uses Tally ERP 9 for accounting purposes and Google Pay and PhonePe for UPI and QR transactions.</p></li><li><p>- Almost 25-30% of transactions are made through QR code in his shop.</p></li></ol><h4 id=q-what-are-the-apps-you-use-for-running-your-business>Q: What are the apps you use for running your business?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> I use Tally ERP 9 for accounting purposes. Apart from this software, I use only 2 applications i.e Google Pay & Phonepe. I am fully confident that my son would expand this business with his skills.</p><h4 id=q-what-is-the-age-of-qr-code-payments-at-your-shop>Q: What is the %age of QR code payments at your shop?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> Almost 25-30% of transactions are made through QR code. I accept Gpay & Phonepe only. I don’t accept Paytm payments from the customers. My son looks after the QR code payments, since I am not very comfortable with it.</p></article></div></div><br><br><br><h4>You might also want to read :</h4><br><ul><li><a href=/interviews/day-life-kirna-merchant/><h5>A Day in the Life of a Kirna Merchant</h5></a></li></ul><div class=comments-area><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=text/javascript>(function(){if(window.location.hostname=="localhost")return;var dsq=document.createElement('script');dsq.type='text/javascript';dsq.async=true;var disqus_shortname='https-cashport-in';dsq.src='//'+disqus_shortname+'.disqus.com/embed.js';(document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]||document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq);})();</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href=https://disqus.com/ class=dsq-brlink>comments powered by <span class=logo-disqus>Disqus</span></a></div></div><div class=col-lg-4><div class=blog_right_sidebar><aside class="single_sidebar_widget post_category_widget"><h4 class=widget_title>Table of Contents</h4><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#backstory>Backstory</a></li><li><a href=#basic-details>Basic Details</a></li><li><a href=#business>Business</a></li><li><a href=#finance-and-banking>Finance and Banking:</a></li><li><a href=#online-portals>Online Portals</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></aside><aside class="single_sidebar_widget post_category_widget"><h4>Related Articles</h4><br><ul><li>- <a style=margin-top:35px href=/interviews/day-life-kirna-merchant/>A Day in the Life of a Kirna Merchant</a></li></ul></aside><aside class="single_sidebar_widget tag_cloud_widget"><h4 class=widget_title>Tags</h4><ul class=list><div class=blog-tags><li><a href=https://cashport.in//tags/pos-terminal/>pos terminal</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href=https://cashport.in//tags/online-payment/>online payment</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href=https://cashport.in//tags/technology-driven/>technology driven</a>&nbsp;</li></div></ul></aside></div></div></div></section><footer class="footer footer_bg_1"><div class=footer_top><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-xl-4 col-md-6 col-lg-4"><div class=footer_widget><div class=footer_logo><a href=#><img src=https://cashport.in/img/logo.png alt></a></div><p>CashPort helps you move your cash to your account by providing a
