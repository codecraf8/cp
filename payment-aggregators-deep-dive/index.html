The SaaS provider onboards its clients via a fairly non-intrusive application process. In most cases, SaaS users can begin accepting payments within an hour of applying.</p><p>This application process collects enough information for required due diligence ( KYC ), however, once complete, there are significant compliance controls and checks for which the SaaS provider is responsible.</p><p>Along with payment integration, compliance, merchant funding, and risk compliance demands, there is a significant amount of time and money that must be invested to make payment aggregation possible.</p><p>The merchant pays a comission only when a customer buys.</p><p>The merchant saves marketing and distribution cost for the product.</p><h2 id=how-does-the-end-user-benefit-in-aggregator-business-model>How does the end-user benefit in Aggregator Business Model?</h2><p>Needs : The aggregators help customers to filter selection based on their needs.</p><p>Trust : The platform aggregates reviews from a multitude of customers, and helps arrive the customers to choose a trusted product or service.</p><p>Cost : By doing a price comparison the end-user buys the product that fits his / her budget.</p><h2 id=what-are-the-typical-aggregator-business-models>What are the typical Aggregator Business Models?</h2><h4 id=merchant-of-record-model>Merchant of Record Model</h4><p>The entity that is authorized, and held liable, by a financial institution to process a consumer’s credit and debit card transactions.</p><p>MoR assumes financial responsibility for its clients.</p><p>example includes <a href=https://squareup.com/us/en>Square Payments</a></p><h4 id=the-payment-facilitator-model>The Payment Facilitator Model</h4><p>Visa defines a payment facilitator as a third-party agent that may do the following: Sign a merchant acceptance agreement on behalf of an acquirer. Receive settlement of transaction proceeds from an acquirer, on behalf of a sub-merchant.</p><p>Here is a list of <a href=https://www.mastercard.us/en-us/business/overview/start-accepting/payment-facilitators.html>MasterCard PayFacs</a></p><h4 id=marketplace-model>Marketplace Model</h4><p>The marketplace is a newly emerged concept, defined by Visa, which provides an electronic commerce website or app to bring the consumers and sellers in the same platform. Also, it manages payments in aid of the retailers on a marketplace.</p><h4 id=staged-digital-wallet-operator-model>Staged-Digital Wallet Operator Model</h4><p>A company that stands upon the Staged-Digital Wallet (SDWO) model offers digital wallet service. The services offered include a transaction facility that can be made via credit/debit card to the SDWO, and processed through the account of its merchant.</p><p>Examples include PayTM Wallet, Amazon Wallet, and others.</p><h2 id=how-payment-aggregators-make-money>How Payment Aggregators Make Money?</h2><p>A payment aggregator relies on backend banks to enable payment services to merchant so the aggregator has to pay to those banks.</p><p>Typical cost structure for e-commerce merchants:</p><p>Debit Cards (below Rs.2000): No Cost</p><p>Debit Cards (Above Rs.2000): Differential pricing for On-Us and Off-us cards (in percentage, %)</p><p>Credit Cards: Differential pricing for On-Us and Off-Us cards (in percentage, %)</p><p>Amex: in % and higher than other cards</p><p>Net-banking: Either fixed cost in percentage (%) of value or revenue sharing (60:40 or 50:50)</p><p>Other payment methods: in percentage (%) of value</p><h2 id=where-do-aggregators-lose-money>Where do Aggregators lose money?</h2><p>Refunds due to online transaction failure.</p><p>Refudns due to product quality issues.</p><h2 id=what-is-the-current-scenario-for-the-aggregator-industry>What is the current scenario for the Aggregator industry?</h2><p>Today, the aggregation business is booming. Cellulant in Kenya currently connects 14 banks into the M-PESA mobile money service for a total value of $70 million pass-through value per month. Pegasus in Uganda processes nearly 200,000 electricity payments per month totaling $10 million in pass-through value. While these figures sound impressive, they do not automatically translate into high profits. Aggregators require significant volumes just to break even.</p><p>Aggregators are now facing intense competition from their own partners in terms of Technical Capability, and Revenue Margins.</p><h2 id=how-does-the-future-look-like-for-aggregator-industry>How does the Future look like for Aggregator industry?</h2><h4 id=digital-lending-products>Digital Lending Products</h4><p>Aggregators are also developing credit scoring algorithms and are trying to position themselves in the emerging market for digital credit products. There are many verticals, including education and entertainment, that are in need of digital financial services to enhance their customer offerings. Food, Retail, and School Chains are some of the early targets.</p><h4 id=own-ciritical-piece-of-value-chain>Own Ciritical Piece of Value Chain</h4><p>The aggregator business model starts with plugging into various sources of supply. The supply could be Drivers(Uber), or rooms(AirBnB), couriers(DoorDash), professionals(Thumbtack) and forth. The second step as we see is that they build supply with direct relationship with suppliers. For instance AirBnB faces competitoin from the likes of Expedia, and finally to beat the competition they become the supply.</p><p>Finally they face stiff competition and offer the supply. An example of an aggregator becoming a supply is eBay launching “eBay Buy APIs” in 2016, though not massively successful it geared $1 Bn in GMV. Expedia and Booking Holdings (Priceline) expose their supply to apps via APIs.</p><p>Aggregators always start with plugging into supply, and eventually evolving into Supply Owners.</p></article></div></div><br><br><br><h4>You might also want to read :</h4><br><ul><li><a href=/payment-aggregators/><h5>Payment Aggregators</h5></a></li><li><a href=/digital-payments/><h5>Digital Payments</h5></a></li><li><a href=/cash-usage-in-india/><h5>Cash Usage in India</h5></a></li><li><a href=/payment-technology-trends/><h5>Payment Technology Trends</h5></a></li></ul><div class=comments-area><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=text/javascript>(function(){if(window.location.hostname=="localhost")return;var dsq=document.createElement('script');dsq.type='text/javascript';dsq.async=true;var disqus_shortname='https-cashport-in';dsq.src='//'+disqus_shortname+'.disqus.com/embed.js';(document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]||document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq);})();</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href=https://disqus.com/ class=dsq-brlink>comments powered by <span class=logo-disqus>Disqus</span></a></div></div><div class=col-lg-4><div class=blog_right_sidebar><aside class="single_sidebar_widget post_category_widget"><h4 class=widget_title>Table of Contents</h4><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#who-is-a-payment-aggregator>Who is a Payment Aggregator?</a></li><li><a href=#what-are-the-pre-requisites-for-being-a-payment-aggregator>What are the pre-requisites for being a Payment Aggregator?</a></li><li><a href=#what-documents-are-required-to-obtain-payment-aggregator-license>What documents are required to obtain Payment Aggregator License?</a></li><li><a href=#what-are-the-benefits-of-payment-aggregator-business-model-for-merchants>What are the Benefits of Payment Aggregator Business Model for Merchants?</a></li><li><a href=#how-does-the-end-user-benefit-in-aggregator-business-model>How does the end-user benefit in Aggregator Business Model?</a></li><li><a href=#what-are-the-typical-aggregator-business-models>What are the typical Aggregator Business Models?</a><ul><li></li></ul></li><li><a href=#how-payment-aggregators-make-money>How Payment Aggregators Make Money?</a></li><li><a href=#where-do-aggregators-lose-money>Where do Aggregators lose money?</a></li><li><a href=#what-is-the-current-scenario-for-the-aggregator-industry>What is the current scenario for the Aggregator industry?</a></li><li><a href=#how-does-the-future-look-like-for-aggregator-industry>How does the Future look like for Aggregator industry?</a><ul><li></li></ul></li></ul></nav></aside><aside class="single_sidebar_widget post_category_widget"><h4>Related Articles</h4><br><ul><li>- <a style=margin-top:35px href=/payment-aggregators/>Payment Aggregators</a></li><li>- <a style=margin-top:35px href=/digital-payments/>Digital Payments</a></li><li>- <a style=margin-top:35px href=/cash-usage-in-india/>Cash Usage in India</a></li><li>- <a style=margin-top:35px href=/payment-technology-trends/>Payment Technology Trends</a></li></ul></aside><aside class="single_sidebar_widget tag_cloud_widget"><h4 class=widget_title>Tags</h4><ul class=list><div class=blog-tags><li><a href=https://cashport.in//tags/payments/>payments</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href=https://cashport.in//tags/payment-tech/>payment-tech</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href=https://cashport.in//tags/marketplace/>marketplace</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href=https://cashport.in//tags/payment-aggregators/>payment aggregators</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href=https://cashport.in//tags/online-payments/>online payments</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href=https://cashport.in//tags/aggregators/>aggregators</a>&nbsp;</li></div></ul></aside></div></div></div></section><footer class="footer footer_bg_1"><div class=footer_top><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-xl-4 col-md-6 col-lg-4"><div class=footer_widget><div class=footer_logo><a href=#><img src=https://cashport.in/img/logo.png alt></a></div><p>CashPort helps you move your cash to your account by providing a
