Merchants processing transactions under an aggregator are known as sub-merchants.</p><p>The provider groups a merchant&rsquo;s business with other merchants and accepts payments on behalf of everyone. The payment aggregator is facilitating the collection of payment from the consumer via credit cards, debit card or bank transfer to the merchant. The merchant is paid by the aggregator in 1-3 working days. The Payment aggregators typically hold consumer credit card detail to allow for faster purchases or hold money in an account to allow for future purchases.</p><p>If you set up a merchant account, you&rsquo;re the owner of that account. Whereas when you use a payment aggregator, you become the sub-merchant and rely on the other company&rsquo;s merchant account.</p><h2 id=advantages-of-using-a-payment-aggregator>Advantages of using a Payment Aggregator</h2><ul><li><p>Applying for being a sub-merchant is fairly simple, without much paper work.</p></li><li><p>A merchant need not worry about the security.</p></li><li><p>The fee structure is straightforward.</p></li><li><p>Most payment aggregators charge a flat fee that is easy to understand.</p></li><li><p>It is cost-effective in short-term.</p></li></ul><h2 id=disadvantages-of-using-a-payment-aggregator>Disadvantages of using a Payment Aggregator</h2><ul><li><p>Delayed funds.

Limit on the amount and number of transactions.</p></li><li><p>Payment aggregators are preferred by most small businesses that process a low number of transactions.</p><h2 id=payment-aggregators-vs-facilitators>Payment Aggregators vs. Facilitators</h2><p>One common point of confusion is the differences between a payment aggregator and a payment facilitator.</p><p>A payment facilitator is a type of model in which a software provider controls the payments relationship with their customers.
The payfac model was popularized in the late 1990s as a way to help small- and medium-size businesses accept online payments more easily.</p><p>Historically, a bank&rsquo;s onboarding requirements catered to larger businesses that could manage the complex, costly, and time-consuming legacy setup processes. Essentially, these companies had to become experts in payments while also building their core business and product.</p></li></ul><p>The Original Model In the traditional payment processing model, a Payment Service Provider would partner with an ISO or other merchant acquirer to find merchants. The ISO would help new merchants set up a MID (Merchant ID) and a merchant account. Then, they would connect the merchant to the PSP&rsquo;s services, who would then process the payment, but would let the acquiring bank handle funding the merchant account.</p><p>A POS software provider, servicing fitness centers or restaurants, can be an example of a payment facilitator; an accommodation and lodging service can serve as an example of a payment aggregator.</p><h2 id=payment-facilitator-vs-iso>Payment Facilitator vs ISO</h2><p>Payment facilitators are targeted at merchants with high processing volumes; and payment aggregators at merchants with low processing volumes.</p><p>A restaurant software (gym software, club management software, or any POS software) company is an example of a classical payment facilitator. Each restaurant using the software can get the merchant account through the POS development company.</p><p>Before payment facilitators began enabling smaller merchants to accept payments, acquiring banks relied on another business model to work directly with SMBs: the independent sales organization, or ISO.</p><p>ISO is the term used by Visa to describe their approved merchant account providers, and MSP is the term used by MasterCard to describe their approved merchant account providers. The process to become an approved merchant account provider is pretty much the same with Visa and MasterCard, but merchant account providers are required to apply separately with each payment network.</p><p>The differences between the two models begin with the terms of the merchant agreements. While card brand rules allow two-party agreements between a PF and a submerchant, the sponsor bank must be a party to the contract when ISOs are involved. In some cases where an ISO is the entity selling services to the merchant, the contract is still between the sponsor and the merchant only, and sometimes the ISO itself will be included in a three-party agreement.</p><p>There are other practical differences between the two models, including the ownership and portability of the merchant portfolio. The PF owns its own submerchant portfolio and may move it from one sponsor to another at will. For ISOs, the ownership and portability of the portfolio varies by contract.</p><p>ISOs and PFs may occupy similar space, but their fundamental differences set them apart from each other. The choices that PFs have when designing their business practices can enable them to have an increased level of control over the submerchant experience when compared to an ISO.</p><h2 id=payment-facilitator-vs-marketplace>Payment Facilitator vs. Marketplace?</h2><p>When it comes to offering payments through your software, it&rsquo;s important to choose the right partnership model for your business. Two models that we hear discussed more and more are payment facilitation and marketplace. While these two partnership types are becoming more and more popular, there is some confusion on what the differences are. The two have some shared features, but they are ultimately very different models.</p><p>A payment facilitator allows sub-merchants under one master merchant to process payments easily, with less hassle. Payment facilitation requires the master merchant (usually the software provider) to take legal and financial responsibility for the transaction that occur under the primary merchant. Merchants under the payment facilitator model can be both brick and mortar and e-commerce.</p><p>A marketplace allows customers to buy from a variety of sellers and retailers at once. A platform that includes multiple sellers isn&rsquo;t inherently a marketplace. Instead, a marketplace has to allow purchase from more than one different seller in a single transaction, like you would be able to in a real, physical marketplace. Amazon is a commonly used example of an online marketplace, since you can fill up your cart with items from several sellers and buy them all with only one transaction.(paragonsolutions.com)</p><h2 id=how-payment-aggregators-make-money>How Payment Aggregators Make Money?</h2><p>A payment aggregator relies on backend banks to enable payment services to merchant so the aggregator has to pay to those banks.</p><p>Typical cost structure for e-commerce merchants:</p><p>Debit Cards (below Rs.2000): No Cost</p><p>Debit Cards (Above Rs.2000): Differential pricing for On-Us and Off-us cards (in percentage, %)</p><p>Credit Cards: Differential pricing for On-Us and Off-Us cards (in percentage, %)</p><p>Amex: in % and higher than other cards</p><p>Net-banking: Either fixed cost in percentage (%) of value or revenue sharing (60:40 or 50:50)</p><p>Other payment methods: in percentage (%) of value</p></article></div></div><br><br><br><h4>You might also want to read :</h4><br><ul><li><a href=/digital-payments/><h5>Digital Payments</h5></a></li><li><a href=/payment-technology-trends/><h5>Payment Technology Trends</h5></a></li></ul><div class=comments-area><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=text/javascript>(function(){if(window.location.hostname=="localhost")return;var dsq=document.createElement('script');dsq.type='text/javascript';dsq.async=true;var disqus_shortname='https-cashport-in';dsq.src='//'+disqus_shortname+'.disqus.com/embed.js';(document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]||document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq);})();</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href=https://disqus.com/ class=dsq-brlink>comments powered by <span class=logo-disqus>Disqus</span></a></div></div><div class=col-lg-4><div class=blog_right_sidebar><aside class="single_sidebar_widget post_category_widget"><h4 class=widget_title>Table of Contents</h4><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#who-is-a-payment-aggregator>Who is a Payment Aggregator?</a></li><li><a href=#advantages-of-using-a-payment-aggregator>Advantages of using a Payment Aggregator</a></li><li><a href=#disadvantages-of-using-a-payment-aggregator>Disadvantages of using a Payment Aggregator</a></li><li><a href=#payment-aggregators-vs-facilitators>Payment Aggregators vs. Facilitators</a></li><li><a href=#payment-facilitator-vs-iso>Payment Facilitator vs ISO</a></li><li><a href=#payment-facilitator-vs-marketplace>Payment Facilitator vs. Marketplace?</a></li><li><a href=#how-payment-aggregators-make-money>How Payment Aggregators Make Money?</a></li></ul></nav></aside><aside class="single_sidebar_widget post_category_widget"><h4>Related Articles</h4><br><ul><li>- <a style=margin-top:35px href=/digital-payments/>Digital Payments</a></li><li>- <a style=margin-top:35px href=/payment-technology-trends/>Payment Technology Trends</a></li></ul></aside><aside class="single_sidebar_widget tag_cloud_widget"><h4 class=widget_title>Tags</h4><ul class=list><div class=blog-tags><li><a href=https://cashport.in//tags/payments/>payments</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href=https://cashport.in//tags/payment-tech/>payment-tech</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href=https://cashport.in//tags/payment-aggregators/>payment-aggregators</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href=https://cashport.in//tags/aggregators/>aggregators</a>&nbsp;</li></div></ul></aside></div></div></div></section><footer class="footer footer_bg_1"><div class=footer_top><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-xl-4 col-md-6 col-lg-4"><div class=footer_widget><div class=footer_logo><a href=#><img src=https://cashport.in/img/logo.png alt></a></div><p>CashPort helps you move your cash to your account by providing a
