      <p>The payment and settlement system comprises various arrangements that are used to systematically, efficiently and securely transfer money/currency, cheques, demand drafts, and money through various electronic channels. In most countries the Central Bank is generally the regulatory authority and is responsible for development of the National Payment System.</p>
<p>Though the Indian payment systems have always been dominated by paper-based transactions, e-payments are not far behind. In the case of India, the RBI has played a pivotal role in facilitating e-payments by making it compulsory for banks to route high value transactions through Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) and also by introducing NEFT (National Electronic Funds Transfer) and NECS (National Electronic Clearing Services) which has encouraged individuals and businesses to switch to electronic methods of payment.</p>
<p>The Board for Regulation and Supervision of Payment and Settlement Systems (BPSS) of the Reserve Bank of India is the highest policy-making body on payment systems in the country.</p>
<h2 id="payment-and-settlement-systems-act-2007">Payment And Settlement Systems Act, 2007</h2>
<p>The PSS Act, 2007 received the assent of the President on 20th December 2007 and came into force with effect from 12th August 2008.</p>
<p>The Payment and Settlement Systems Act 2007, set up by the RBI , provides for the regulation and supervision of payment systems in India and designates the apex institution (RBI) as the authority for that purpose and all related matters. To exercise its powers and perform its functions and discharge its duties, the RBI is authorized under the Act to constitute a committee of its central board, which is known as the Board for Regulation and Supervision of Payment and Settlement Systems (BPSS). The Act also provides the legal basis for netting’ and settlement finality’.</p>
<p>The PSS Act, 2007 received the assent of the President on 20th December 2007 and came into force with effect from 12th August 2008.</p>
<p>Under the PSS Act, 2007, two Regulations have been made by the RBI, namely, the Board for Regulation and Supervision of Payment and Settlement Systems Regulations, 2008 ( BPSS Regulations ) and the Payment and Settlement Systems Regulations, 2008 ( PPS Regulations, 2008 &lsquo;). Both these Regulations came into force along with the PSS Act, 2007 on 12th August 2008. They together provide the necessary statutory backing to the RBI for overviewing the payment and settlement systems in the country.</p>
<h2 id="difference-between-payment-and-settlement">Difference Between Payment and Settlement</h2>
<p>According to the definition of PSS Act 2007, Payment System means a system that enables payment to be effected between a payer and a beneficiary, involving clearing, payment or settlement service or all of them. This includes the systems enabling credit card operations, debit card operations, smart card operations, money transfer operations or similar operations. However, as per Section 34 of the PSS act, the above definition of payment system is not applicable to stock exchanges or clearing corporations set up under stock exchange.</p>
<p>Settlement means the settlement of payment instructions received and these include settlement of securities, foreign exchange or derivatives or other transactions. Settlement can take place either on a net basis or on a gross basis. Both netting and gross settlement system are defined under the Act thereon.</p>
<h2 id="difference-between-payment-instruction-and-payment-obligation">Difference between Payment Instruction and Payment Obligation</h2>
<p>Payment Instruction is defined as any instrument, authorization or order in any form, including by electronic means, to effect a payment by a person to a participant in a payment system or from one participant in such a system to another participant in that system.</p>
<p>The payment instruction can be communicated either manually i.e. through an instrument like a cheque draft, payment order etc. or through electronic means, so that a payment can be made by either a person to the participant in such a system or between two participants.</p>
<p>Payment obligation is defined as what is owed by one participant in a payment system to another such participant, which results from clearing or settlement or payment instructions relating to funds, securities or foreign exchange or derivatives or other transactions.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-payment-system">What is a Payment System?</h2>
<p>Section 2(1) (i) of the PSS Act 2007 defines a payment system to mean a system that enables payment to be effected between a payer and a beneficiary, involving clearing, payment or settlement service or all of them, but does not include a stock exchange (Section 34 of the PSS Act 2007 states that its provisions will not apply to stock exchanges or clearing corporations set up under stock exchanges). It is further stated by way of an explanation that a “payment system” includes the systems enabling credit card operations, debit card operations, smart card operations, money transfer operations or similar operations.</p>
<p>All systems (except stock exchanges and clearing corporations set up under stock exchanges) carrying out either clearing or settlement or payment operations or all of them are regarded as payment systems. All entities operating such systems will be known as system providers. Also all entities operating money transfer systems or card payment systems or similar systems fall within the definition of a system provider. To decide whether a particular entity operates the payment system, it must perform either the clearing or settlement or payment function or all of them.</p>
<h2 id="payment-system-operators-in-india">Payment System Operators in India</h2>
<p>Payment system operator means a person responsible for the operation of a payment system and that ensures the operation of the payment system in accordance with the PSS Act and implementing regulations issued on the basis thereof. A payment system operator shall be responsible for the comprehensive management of all risks in the payment system. “person” means any natural person, any legal person, any state and any political subdivision, agency or instrumentality of a state.</p>
<p>Payment system operators refer to the following different type of entities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Financial Market Infrastructure</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Retail Payments Organisation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cards Payment Networks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cross border Money Transfer – in-bound only</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ATM Networks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pre-paid Payment Instruments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>White Label ATM Operators</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As per RBI Publicaton dated Jul 1, 2020 there are 78 active payment system operators in India. <a href="https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/PublicationsView.aspx?id=12043">https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/PublicationsView.aspx?id=12043</a></p>
<h2 id="pssa-and-e-commerce-cod">PSSA and E-Commerce COD</h2>
<p>In the CoD method, Flipkart, Amazon and other ecommerce players collect cash from customers on behalf of third-party vendors at the time the goods are delivered instead of demanding online payment at the time of placing the order.</p>
<p>An RTI had been filed by Dharmendra Kumar of India FDI Watch. Replying to a Right To Information (RTI) query, the RBI, said &ldquo;“Aggregators/payment intermediaries like Amazon and Flipkart are not authorised under Section 8 of the PSS (Payments and Settlements Systems) Act, 2007”.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The RBI Notification dated 24 November, 2009 defines Intermediaries as “Intermediaries would include all entities that collect monies received from customers for payment to merchants using any electronic/online payment mode, for goods and services availed by them and, subsequently, facilitate the transfer of these monies to the merchants in final settlement of the obligations of the paying customers.”</p>
<p>Legal experts hold the view that the rules don’t necessarily invalidate cash-on-delivery. As the PSS Act mentions electronic and online payment, but doesn’t make explicit mention of the money received through the CoD route.</p>
<p>PSS Act 2007 provides that the RBI authorizations are required for certain classes of activities while carving an important exception for Cash on Delivery transactions. There is no authorisation required for “any person acting as the duly appointed agent of another person to whom the payment is due”.</p>
<p>E-commerce marketplaces take authorisation from sellers to collect payments on their behalf either online or offline. In both cases, the exception above applies and they are not required to be licensed under the PSS Act.</p>
<h2 id="payment-and-settlement-system-in-india-vision-2019-21">Payment and Settlement System in India Vision 2019-21</h2>
<p>The Payment and Settlement System in India Vision 2019-21 document published by the central bank on Wednesday has laid out a comprehensive roadmap of initiatives to be undertaken by all stakeholders and governing bodies to ensure the successful completion of these objectives in this time.</p>
<p>Aiming at a ‘cash-lite’ society, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday released a vision document for ensuring a safe, secure, convenient, quick and affordable e-payment system as it expects the number of digital transactions to increase more than four times to 8,707 crore in December 2021.</p>
<p>RBI said the payment systems landscape will continue to change with further innovation and entry of more players.</p>
<p>The digital payment transaction turnover vis–vis gross domestic product (at current market prices) is expected to further increase to 10.37 per cent in 2019, 12.29 per cent in 2020, and 14.80 per cent in 2021.</p>
<p>The latest vision document said payment systems like UPI/IMPS are likely to register average annualised growth of over 100%</p>
<p>A four-fold increase in digital payments , reduction in paper-based transactions, improved pricing, better customer grievance redressal mechanisms and establishment of new payment system operators (PSO) are among the list of twelve objectives the Reserve Bank of India seeks to achieve in the next three years.</p>
